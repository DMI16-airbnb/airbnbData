Also we do not ask a cleaning fee. Please leave the apartment tidy and clean, as you found it at arrival. Cleaning products and a vacuum cleaner are provided.
A few points of attention please:

•The geyser has an electronic ignition by placing the handle in the middle and pushing the knob a few times until there is a flame again. Move the handle to the right for extra hot water.
•The couch sofa becomes a bed by pulling the seat towards you, then the matress expands itself. Push the couch sofa towards the wall to make it a seat again.

Built during the city’s Golden Age, the three parallel canals are interconnected with streets filled with shopping, eating and drinking opportunities. The Canal Ring is made up of Herengracht, Keizersgracht and Prinsengracht. In a way, the Canal Ring forms a crossover from the more bustling Centre to the gentler outer neighbourhoods of Jordaan, Museum District and De Pijp. The Canal Ring includes the city’s two main nightlife and culture squares. Leidseplein features such legendary concert halls as Paradiso and Melkweg. Rembrandtplein has several bars, two large nightclubs (Escape and Air), and ‘old world’ evocative treasures such as De Kroon and Café Schiller. The whole area is dotted with Amsterdam's beloved neighbourhood ‘brown cafes'.

When the weather is fine you can install yourself with a glass of wine on the the frontdoor platform and whatch one after the other Dutch celebrity pass by cycling. And which way you leave the street, around every corner is something to see and to do. One side of the street leads to the Artis zoo, Resistance museum, Scheepvaart museum, Tropen museum and Dappermarkt. And the other side to the Hermitage museum, theatre Carre, Magere Brug en Utrechtse straat.

Another 100 meters and you are at the monday morning flower market on Amstelveld.

There is always something happening in the local area, in December, for example, most of the Amsterdam Light festival takes place in the Plantage area.

In someone else's house there are always many things different. For example, we put a lot of the lights on one switch and some light switches are slightly hidden. But the most important thing  to know is that you are staying in a souterrain (basement) apartment where the main drain is on 60 cm height, so all  transport goes with pumps and broyeurs. No problem if you trow your  waste in the waste bin before you put your plates etc. in the dishwasher and if you don’t put waste or fat in the sink.

Around the corner from Rembrandt House, Diamond factory, Opera, Nieuwmarkt, but in a quiet spot. New - not so soft (!) bed....

Our house is a grade 1 listed canal side warehouse built in approximately 1620 on one of the wider and most beautiful canals in central Amsterdam. If you you like charming old buildings this house will not disappoint you! The house has gone through many changes in the 400 odd years since it was built, but was restored to it's original state in the 1940's. We bought the house with friends 10 years ago and renovated it to suit our needs; two families and a bow maker's workshop (violin bows). We created this studio apartment on the second floor for my mother in law, but she remarried at 70 and moved to America so now we rent it out! It is a non smoking studio apartment (one room plus en-suite bathroom) of about 38 square meters, with a private entrance on the second floor. It has large double warehouse windows which you can fully open to enjoy the stunning view in the afternoon and evening sun. There is a double bed (multiple pocket sprung mattress), we can supply a cot and/or a camp bed if you bring a child, There is a small leather couch and a tv/dvd player, full kitchenette and a bathroom with a warmed tile floor, a full size bathtub/shower and a washer/dryer. Free WiFi, iron, hairdryer etc. We kept as many of the original features as possible. The old beams are all exposed, the lead windows and the shutters (which you can close to shut out the light if you are jet- lagged) are still there, with modern oak flooring and very good central heating for the winter. 
In terms of both the house itself and it's location you will have  a truly 'typical Amsterdam' experience here. We are on a very quiet and peaceful canal despite our very central location. 5 -10 minutes walk away you find; the Rembrandt House (from the same period as our house); the Hermitage; the Opera/Ballet; the Waterlooplein flea market; the Nieuwmarkt and China Town; Rembrandtplein etc. The Metro (3 min. walk) has direct connections to the business area and the Arena and we are a 12 minute walk or one Metro stop (Nieuwmarkt) from Amsterdam Central station. The nearest supermarket is a 4 minute walk, and you can hire a bicycle around the corner. We would not recommend bringing your car as parking is very expensive here in the center, however there are lots of park and ride possibilities. A short stroll away is a huge variety of restaurants to choose from.
If you hate classical music our house is not for you! You are quite likely to hear us practicing viola, cello or bass, and the customers of the bow workshop on the ground floor trying the bows out. There might also be the odd chamber music rehearsal upstairs. We are all highly trained professional musicians so hopefully it will not sound too bad and we never work after 10 pm.

A private apartment with sheets, towels, and fully equipped kitchen, bathtub and washing maschine.

We just greet the guests and aswer any questions, otherwise you get the keys and have free access and a private entrance to your place.

Dappermarkt is one of the country’s oldest - and best - outdoor markets. It forms the multicultural heart of the neighbourhood along with such major arteries as Javastraat, which once only provided every manner of global grocery but is now beginning to feature more upscale cafes and terraces. One of the city’s largest general hospitals, OLVG, is also located here. Two stellar city parks, Oosterpark and Flevopark, provide quick escape from the relatively busy streets. Besides many cheap ethnic eateries and supermarkets, the area is attracting much more higher-end cafes and restaurants who are often re-inventing many of the area’s industrial monuments. On sunny days, the parks and terraces are filled with nice people.

The house is light, bright and lovely. It's been recently refurbished so everything looks shiny and fresh. Both the bathroom and kitchen are modern and comfortable. And my girlfriend has done most of the decorating, so it's got class ;). 

My personal touch can be found in a small (female friendly!) man cave with nice old cinema seats, a projector and surround sound system. Great for creating your own home cinema, or for playing on the Wii U or Playstation! The room can also be used as a quiet office space, with a pleasant chair and desk.

The river Amstel gave the city it's name! From here all the other canals in the city radiate outwards, like spokes in a wheel. We're right across from the famous Carré theatre, the fancy Prinsengracht is around the corner, as are the boutique shopping street Utrechtsestraat and the Waterloo square with its fun daily fleamarket. And of course there the Magere Brug (the iconic 'Skinny Bridge') right on our doorstep.

Metro station Waterloo Square is a 5-minute walk away and the convenient tram 4 stops around the corner.

Our wonderful view comes at a small price: do note that our appartment is at the top of a very steep flight of stairs. If you have impaired mobility, I'm afraid it might not be for you. 

Finally, our bed is quite old-school and rather small for a 2-person bed (1.20 x 1.90). Very snug and romantic of course, but if you need space to sprawl, feel free to inflate our luxurious kingsize matress!","The house is light, bright and lovely.

This place is very close to the centre of Amsterdam and in the middle of the famous area 'the pipe' and upcoming 'east'. I advise you to visit both :-).

General information
It is very easy to travel by public transport to my apartment. My apartment is nearby the Amsterdam Amstel Station (train),  Wibautstraat (subway) and Berlagebrug (tram). So if you have internet access in Holland, I advise you to download the app '9292'. I use this app all the time for traveling with public transport. This app gives you information about departure times, which platform, the most easiest and fasted way of transport etc. I really advise you to think about buying a public transport chip card. With this card you can travel by train, tram and subway (metro). Having this card you don't need to buy a ticket every time  when you are about to travel by tram, train or subway. The tram is really nice to use for sightseeing on your way and the subway is quick and fast. Or maybe you would like to rent a bike? A store in my neighborhood (10-15 minute walk) rents bikes, you can see the adress in my airbnb quide.

Although you think this might be weird....i do not have a tv. This because I think we should enjoy more of our time outside and relax when we are inside. Of course you can use free wifi in my apartment to check the news etc.","I'm still falling in love everyday with the location, the apartment and the ambience.

The Neighborhood (in walking distance):

'Volkshotel' at Wibautavenue is the place to be. There is a huge rooftopterras, DJ's, yoga, but off course also drinks, bites and live music.

'Bar Buckowski' is hot, especially friday in the afternoon. All the locals come to this place for after work drinks. Lots of goodlooking people.
The same goes for' Hesp' at the Amstel. In the sun, at the water, loads of people come there (also by boat) to enjoy each others company. Youngsters also play petangue here. Good fun!
And last but not least: 'De Biertuin' (beergarden), countless different beers in good atmosphere, with huge terras.

Oosterpark is perfect for a walk when you don't want to be runover by joggers. And recently it had a complete make-over, so its beautiful to wonder around. In early summer there are also events (music festivals).

Canals! The famous Amstel, from where you can hop on a boat, is only a few minute walk from the apartment. Explore the city by boat, it's even more amazing from the water.

'Albert Cuypmarket'. Walk on the endless Albert Cuyp where you can still find the typical 'Amsterdammers'. People who live there all their lives. They make the city for what it is. Including loads of terrasses where you can enjoy a coffee or beer in the sun.

Rembrandtplein, where all your touristic wishes come true. Coffeeshops, bars, crowds, cinema's, disco, even more bars, theatre and many, many other tourists :-). If you want a big night out, this is the place to be.

-Metrostation 200 meters
-Tram 75 meters
-Trainstation 1300 meters
-By foot, lots of things are in walking distance
-Every sunday free parking in front of the house. (other day's you can buy a day pass. There are enough parkinglots closeby).

Dappermarkt is one of the country’s oldest - and best - outdoor markets. It forms the multicultural heart of the neighbourhood along with such major arteries as Javastraat, which once only provided every manner of global grocery but is now beginning to feature more upscale cafes and terraces. One of the city’s largest general hospitals, OLVG, is also located here. Two stellar city parks, Oosterpark and Flevopark, provide quick escape from the relatively busy streets. Besides many cheap ethnic eateries and supermarkets, the area is attracting much more higher-end cafes and restaurants who are often re-inventing many of the area’s industrial monuments. On sunny days, the parks and terraces are filled with nice people.

In de middle of town in the cosy neighborhood 'de pijp'. Roof terrace & terrace boat to enjoy the sun and summer all day long. Or explore the city by boat? Be Welcome!

A very light and bright houseboot! You'll have an unforgettable holiday here with the broad view on the Amstel river and Dutch skies. A lot of space but still in de middle of Amsterdam, in the cosy neighborhood 'De Pijp' with its many bars and restaurants and the famous Albert Cuyp market. 

You can enjoy the sun in the morning and afternoon at the terrace-boat that is in front at the Amstel. Magnificent views from basically everywhere in the boat. And please note: looking over the wide Amstel rivier, any weather is beautiful to watch. 

You can use the electric powered 'sloep' as much als you like, easy to use, silent, it is just the best way to explore Amsterdam en enjoy each other.

On the roof terrace there is sun all day, so you can also enjoy your diner there. Imagine long summer days sitting outside, relaxing, without neighbors close by.

There are two floors, around 180 m2. The above level is split in three by small steps - in the centre the kitchen, the both other parts have coutches, a swingchair, and if you're with children, a lot of room to play.

You'll sleep downstairs, always a nice temperature, seeing and hearing the water birds - also when you're using the bath...

The white squared boat is located at the end of its own footbridge, next to a traditional houseboat. You'll reach the entrance by a sturdy wide footbridge (very safe) surrounded with plants and flowers. 

Only one small part of the house will be closed (workshop), the rest of the boat is yours to enjoy.

We are always happy to answer your questions and when we're not able to welcome you ourselfes we'll make sure someone is there to welcome you and show you around.

The neighborhood 'The Pijp' is super! Just outside the busy city center, but your car you van 5 minute walk to many bars and restaurants.  10 min walk to the Albert Cuyp market, the cosy cafe's en restaurants. Opposite our boat, on the other site of the Amstel, there are also some really nice restaurants (tapas, portugese 'girassol') and terraces on the boulevard. 

Our home is very close to the Amstel station, 10 min walk, from where trains and subways come and go, and where a bike rent is located. 

If you want to enjoy more greenary - follow the Amstel southwards, up until Ouderkerk and on the other side back - there is even a small ferry to help you cross the water to shorten your trip :-)

Check out 'thuis aan de amstel' - on the 'top' of the amstel, also walking distance!

On the Amstel side, towards de city center: The Hermitage, Joods Historisch museum, Waterlooplein. And of course, Artis! Our Zoo. 
Well, there's so much to do, I could go on for hours ;-) 

We will leave a house manual with lots of tips in the house.

The upperfloor, which is under the roof, has two bedrooms and a bathroom. The bath is situated in the master bedroom, so you can bathe with lots of space around you. We are sure you will enjoy are house and its neighbourhood!

Amsterdam East is one of the upcoming or so called hipster neighbourhoods in Amsterdam! It almost seems that a new hotspot pops up almost every day in this neighbourhood. It’s nearby the city centre, but has such a different vibe. A drink at the rooftop of The Volkshotel is a must to enjoy the stunning views over Amsterdam! When it comes to restaurants there is something for everyone. From trendy coffee bars, industrial warehouses, cocktail bars to concept stores! The Czaar Peter Street and the Javastraat are some of the best shopping streets on the East side of town. All kinds of trendy shops can be found here. On a sunny day it’s definitely a must to visit Roest for a drink on the waterfront. If you want the local feel and multi-culti then stroll over the Dappermarket or wander around the Oosterpark. The renewed Beukenplein is perfect for a drink afterwards!","This gorgeous apartment is excellently designed with your comfort in mind.

It brings you to and from the two main train stations and - with one stopover - to the Airport. Buses and trams are near too. When you arrive by plane: take the train to RAI or Central Station and the metro will bring you to the Stop with the name Waterlooplein. Choose exit Nieuwe Herengracht. After the gates turn left in the tunnel and left again when you are above ground. Walk through the small park, cross the bridge and turn right immediately after the bridge. You find number 56 at your left, the water is at your right.I expect it won't take more than an hour to get to the metro exit. From there you walk at most five minutes.

Our house is a real family home. It has been fully redecorated by ourselves, as we bought this house completely run down in 2010. We've opened up the living room, adding the staircase (and a lot of light) to the room. We love the view; the Rembrandt tower and the communal garden make a lovely mix of Big City and Green Area. On the same floor as the living room, there's a spacious double bedroom, with a small balcony attached. The kitchen is one of our favorite places, with a dining table so you can have cosy dinners. Upstairs there's a large roof terrace with sun though out the day - needless to say this was one of the reasons we bought the house. Upstairs are also our son's and daughter's bedrooms and an open area which we use as a work space for Bas. We have child safety protection throughout the house, with kids proof electricity sockets and staircase fences.

You'd have access to everything, really. We're not there ourselves, so the house is yours. Our cat will be there for your company, if you want, and we would love it if you can take care of our plants.

We will not be here ourselves, as we are abroad. But we have excellent neighbors and a caretaker that will hand you the key and who can can show you around or give tips and tricks.

Although we're located quite central in the city (10 minutes by bike to Dam Square), the neighborhood is quiet and relaxed. We live close to the Amstel river, the famous Canvas club and Baut restaurant and popular districts like de Pijp and Watergraafsmeer. More and more hip little coffee bars and (tapas) restaurants are opening their doors making a stroll in the neighborhood always worthwhile. In front of our  house, there's a communal garden, with lovely walking paths to enjoy all the flowers and crops.

Transport is an added bonus: the subway stop is only a 3 minute walk, and gets you into downtown in three stops (5 minutes). The A10 highway is also close by, and we can even include two bikes to the deal. To make you feel really local :-)","Our house is a real family home. It has been fully redecorated by ourselves, as we bought this house completely run down in 2010. We've opened up the living room, adding the staircase (and a lot of light) to the room. We love the view; the Rembrandt tower and the communal garden make a lovely mix of Big City and Green Area. On the same floor as the living room, there's a spacious double bedroom, with a small balcony attached. The kitchen is one of our favorite places, with a dining table so you can have cosy dinners.

Wim Soens (17 March 2011) I’ve seen a lot of B&B’s, but I will remember the Flying Pancake for a long time. What a lovely place this is! Very comfortable and charming, and I especially enjoyed the steam shower. Claudia is a great host and made me feel at home right away. I’ll definitely recommend this place to my friends.

Fransiska, Florence (14 March 2011) The best B&B I've ever stayed in. Room was lovely, very clean with a wonderful bathroom with a steam shower. Breakfast was at your door every morning with fresh breads, cheeses and meats. Claudia was a great landlady and provide us bikes and precious hints/suggestions. Would definitely stay here again.

Tony, London (07 March 2011) The Flying Pancake offers two separate apartments on the top floors of a typical Dutch house. Each one consists of cooking area, bedroom, living area and bathroom. The level and quality of amenities is very high - the overall feeling is of informal, comfort. I've stayed here several times, and look forward to doing so again later in the year.

Don, California (02 February 2011) Quiet, quaint, great location, good food for breakfast! So much more personal than a hotel. Very clean and all ammenities provided!

Martin & Denise, Malta (08 July 2010) We stayed in The Captain's Suite at the end of June and were very pleased we had chosen The Flying Pancake. The house is in a pleasant and quiet neighbourhood (far enough away from the city centre to be relaxing but close enough to be convenient for all the sights).

The suite was lovely and exceeded our expectations and Claudia is a friendly and welcoming host.

We were fortunate to enjoy beautiful weather during our stay so each day we walked into the city (a leisurely 20 minute or so walk) although there was a tram stop close by should we have needed to use it.

We enjoyed staying here very much and would have no hesitation in recommending it to others. We hope to return one day.

John Bullen (25 May 2010) Last week was my second stay at The Flying Pancake while visiting Amsterdam. The Captain's Cabin was spacious, comfortable, charming, and the steam shower will be sorely missed until my next visit. Claudia ensured that all my questions were answered, and she is truly a gracious and accomodating host. The Pancake is located in an historic old Jewish quarter and while not directly in the ""party"" area of the city, it is within just a few steps of the trams which will get you anywhere you wish to go in the city. The #9 tram comes along every 10 minutes or so and will get you to Rembrandt Square - one of the several ""entertainment areas"" - within just a few minutes ride. If you prefer your own transportation, Claudia has bikes to rent at very reasonable rates, and there is an electric scooter sales and rental business just a few doors down the street which rents at 5 Euro a day less than anywhere else I saw.

The Flying Pancake is definitely on my recommended B&B list for anyone wishing a wonderful experience while in beautiful Amsterdam.

Michael & Deborah Orr (13 March 2010) The Cook's Suite - March 2010. Top marks = 10/10. A truly special guesthouse experience with great attention to detail. A warm and welcoming 'innkeeper.' 
The location is not absolutely central, but this means you get to see far more of the district between the guesthouse and the city centre and = peace and quiet when you wish for it! Would choose this over a hotel every time. Just be prepared for the typically steep and narrow Dutch staircases!
Thanks Claudia for a wonderful few days...Best wishes, Michael and Debbie

I will stay very close by. Almost always available by phone and e-mail.

This neighborhood is the exact border between the fancy Amsterdam-South district. And up & coming East district. The Weesperzijde area is flourishing.

* Non smoking please, but there is a good outside terrace where you can enjoy your cigarette.
* IMPORTANT: the sewerage system is different on a boat. Please do not throw too much toilet paper inside the toilet or any other things than normal paper. Please Please DON'T EVER DISPOSE OF SANITARY TOWELS or other cotton-based hygienic wipes in our toilets. This will cause the sewage-pump to fail, with very serious consequences indeed. Please also notify other guests / children etc about this very important issue. You can put these items in the hygienic-bin beside the toilet. 
* Don't take any of the inside furniture outside. I have special furniture for outside and please only use these. 
* Close all the windows when you leave the house and be sure to lock the front door properly.
* Sorry, no dogs (very small ones can be discussed - I do actually like them).","Built late 2014, this stunning houseboat offers the unique Amsterdam experience. Located on the lower Amstel, the river that gave Amsterdam her name. 

Sunny, centrally located, safe, quiet, outdoor private space. For couple or family with 2 kids
  ","Built late 2014 this stunning houseboat (135m2) will offer an experience you will not easily forget. Located uniquely on the Amstel, the river that gave Amsterdam her name. 

Light/central/close to stores & restaurants/safe/quiet/easy access/private

The ground floor is comprised of a modern kitchen which is fully equipped (dishwasher, oven, microwave, fridge, stove with 4 burners, wash machine, water cooker, coffee machine and blender) and has all the needs for a comfortable stay in the city. There is a big dining table in the open kitchen where you can enjoy breakfast/dinner with a view on the canal.
The big dining table is part of the sitting room with a cosy 'see through' gas fire place and a large sofa bed couch (2 grown ups), sliding doors to the outdoor terrace. At the entrance you will find a separate toilet. 4 big windows shed an abundance of light in to the space - which can be prevented by curtains if so desired. And of course makes it possible to enjoy the view. Its spacious but not overwhelmingly large (about 50m2); sun deck/terrace excluded. 

One level down (yes, half under water) one will find a large state of the art bathroom - with a second toilet, bath, rain shower etc., a  laundry room (may be used; washer and dryer), 2 spacious bedrooms (one is the guestroom that we rent out), and 2 smaller rooms currently used for storage. 

The bed in the guestroom is 180 by 210 cm (king seize - 2 separate matrasses with a topper but cannot be divided into 2 beds). You may opt for 2 separate duvet's or choose one romantic big one. 
If you are with two friends and you would rather not share a bed, then you can use the upstairs sofa couch. Bedding is available, just ask in advance. 

Heating is provided through floor heating throughout the house and if you want to add a pinch; use the gas fireplace. 
Just to be clear; (hot) water, gas and electricity are available as if it were a normal house. Also available is wifi through out the house, a sonos hifi system and TV set. 

In total the living space ex terrace is about 120 m2 - but looks a lot smaller from the outside. 

Don't worry about motion sickness, the boat might move somewhat due to wind or waves at times but only ever so slightly. 98% of the time you will not notice the house moving at all. 

Note that the master bedroom usually is not rented out. Can be discussed, but a subsequent charge will be added.

Own entrance by gang board - through front door. During your stay you will have the whole premises to yourself, there will be no other guests nor will we be there.

As we only rent out the space when traveling (mostly for business), the chance we will meet in person is small. However, my neighbours (native English speakers) are very helpful (and key holders) as other potential key holders you might encounter.
I respond quickly to emails - basically, I'm always online if not sleeping. 

As we do live there, its inevitable that you will find traces of our lives in the boat - although we try to keep that to a bare minimum.

Within walking distance you can find an abundance of nice local restaurants from (very) posh, to trendy, small & local, or business type venues. Notably, the best vegetarian restaurant in town (Betty's) is a 5 min walk away. 

Supermarkets and other shops are also 5 min walk away, all can be found on the Rijnstraat (Albert Heijn being our most well known).

Very conveniently located! 

Train & Metro
Its a seven minute walk to Amstel train station (train and metro) from where you can travel to central station Amsterdam (10 min), Schiphol (25 min) or Utrecht and beyond (25 min). 

Tram & bus
Its a 2 minute walk to buses and trams that will get you to the city center (our better said: the canal ring) in less than 15 minutes. Or just stroll up the Amstel river on a nice day which is a gorgeous walk day or night! (romantic too). The area is very safe, you can walk around at any time day or night without having to worry (not withstanding normal cautious behavior of course). 

Note that the 'Rivierenbuurt' - as my neighborhood is called - is still considered to belong the inner area of Amsterdam. Close to the trendy 'Oost' (East) and the 'De Pijp' area. The canal ring ('Jordaan' or 'Centrum') is about 10 to 15 min by public transport. 

We have a cat (and part time children at times). If you are hugely allergic, this might be a problem. Of course we keep the house very tidy and clean. Unless you are great cat lovers (the cat is of course awesome), he will not be there when the boat is rented out.  

The sounds from the street are hard to hear inside (very isolated), if you open the windows there will be some noise during rush-hours. The bedroom downstairs is quiet. Other than that, you might hear duck like sounds, or rowing boats. 

Clean and fresh linens will waiting upon arrival 

Guests are most welcome to use appliances to cook and ingredients like salt, peper, oil, butter etc. 

Any cost of damage or theft between arrival and departure will immediately be recovered

Guests are welcome to the livingroom, kitchen, both bathrooms and their guest room. Of course also to enjoy the outdoor area as much as possible too.

As its our own house most likely we will be traveling when guests are staying in the houseboat. However, always reachable by phone and with friendly neighbors, so far all has always gone well.

In order to get to the boat you need to take the metro at metro stop Diemen-Zuid, hop on metro nr 53 to Central Station (CS) Amsterdam, 4 stops will take you to Amstel Station where you exit. If you take the back exit from Amstel Station and walk towards the water you can see the houseboat on the other side of the water. You just need to walk via the bridge on your right hand (Berlage brug) to get there (7 min). Total trip I estimate is about 30 min max.

With a spacious living room, a large dining room, 4 bedrooms and a garden, it's perfect for design-loving families.

Our apartment was recently renovated (2013) by a well known architect. The living space and dining room are spacious enough for everyone to enjoy themselves. The dining room has an open kitchen, with a large Italian stove (double oven, hot plate), a breakfast bar with designer stools, a large dining table that seats 8 people comfortably. From the dining room two doors open to our beautiful, spacious garden with custom built outdoor kitchen, sofa's, table and chairs to enjoy dinner outside. For the children we have a trampoline, swing and hammock. [Pictures will follow soon!]

The living room connects to the dining room. It features two large couches, a built in fire place (electric), large Loewe tv-system, and a semi-seperate play room with toys for the children.

Living room and dining room both have separate toilet spaces.

The bedrooms are situated in the souterrain. We have 1 large children's room with two beds, tv and dvd, and Wii-computer. The other children's room is larger, and features 1 bed (easily fits an extra bed upon request). This room has a door that opens to the garden.

The children's bath room has a bath, rain shower and toilet.

The master bed room features a queen size bed, tv and dvd, built in closet, and an en suite bathroom with rain shower, toilet and double sink.

There's a fourth bedroom that serves as a home office. This room has a twin guest bed and separate entree to the street.

Our guests can enjoy free and fast wifi. The house has a Sonos music system that connects to online and wireless radio etc.

Amsterdam is best and easily enjoyed by bike. Two adult and one children's (10-12 years) bikes are available and free for you to use.

Our apartment is on a typical Amsterdam Canal that's quiet yet central. We are around the corner of Carré Theater. Artis Zoo is a 5 minute walk. The hip shopping street Utrechtsestraat is a 10 minute walk, that you'll reach by crossing the famous skinny bridge. Waterlooplein is also a 10 minute walk away.

We love our neighborhood because of the proximity of restaurants, bars and musea, without having to deal with the noise and chaos. Only steps away you'll find numerous good breakfast bars that serve great coffee.

Amsterdam is so small, every part of the city is within close reach wherever your place. But Love the diversity of my neighborhood, 'De Pijp'. The apartment itself is set right along the Amstelriver. On the other side there's great places to take an evening meal or stretch your legs for a walk. Takes about 15/20 minutes and your right in the center of the city. Plenty of small streets , odd and interesting little shops, especially near the Albert Cuypmarket wich is about 10 minutes walk from the house. More info and tips will be provided on location of course.

Tram line 4 which takes you to the Central railway station in about 15 minutes is 5 minutes walking distance as is line 3 which circles the city from east to west. 
Easiest way to get here from the airport is by taxi that will cost around 40-50 euro. More economic is to take the train to CS then tram 4 to 'Lutmastraat' and walk to the Amsteldijk (5 min). Or alternately, considering you have luggage, take a taxi from the CS, around 10/15 euro's. If arriving by your own car, there's usually plenty of parkingplace along the Amsteldijk during day-time, but it costs 4 euro p/h. Better to park at an P&R (park&ride facility), omly 1 euro p/d if you arrive after 10am with an maximum stay of 4 days. The RAI P&R is nearest to Amsteldijk, appr. 15 min. walking distance. (URL HIDDEN)

The building is old (1904) but in excellent condition. One note of major importance, this appartement is not suitable for small/young children as there are many stairs so they cannot be left unattended. 
The entrance staircase is in classic Amsterdam style, which means its steep and narrow (almost like a ladder). They did this to save more space for living. This means you need to be reasonably fit to stay here (or it will make you fit ;-)) and therefor it's not suited for people with limited physical mobility, unfortunately.","Building from 1904 with old plastered ceilings and other fittings intact.

It's a wide open space of approx. 5 by 20 meters. Many windows and sunshine throughout the day. 
Once you get on board you hardly realize you're in a boat. Luxurious furniture and a really big soft bed (200 x 220cm). It's great to sit upstairs in the ""captains cabin"" and watch all the boats go by :)



The entire boat together with all it's facilities. 

I will not stay on the boat during your stay but I'm available 24/7 for questions. (e-mail or phone)

The boat is located in an A+ location. I bet everybody in Holland knows this location. I live between all the big museums and theaters in a very vivid neighborhood. There are over 30 restaurants within a 5 minute walk radius. 
All the big touristic locations (if you're in for that) are within 5 minutes by tram.

There's a tramstop only 50 meters away from my house. (Line 4) This will take you to the most attractions and also to/from Central Station. Very convenient if you choose to come by plane. 
But basically you can walk to every location. (or rent a bike, if you dare..)

Since this is a boat you might wonder if there's a lot of rocking motion involved. I promise you there is not. 
Because it's so heavy and large, and there is no big traffic on the Keizersgracht channel, the boat will not rock. 
Some occasional boat sounds can be heard. Waterpomp, boats passing by, the 'kracken' of the ship. I find them rather romantic!

Washing machine available. Dishwasher available. 
Superfast wifi (150mb/s). Microwave/oven. Qooker for instant boiling water. Small TV.

Parking is very expensive in Amsterdam. 52 euro a day in front of my house. There are possibilities to park your car cheap. Send me a message and I can help you to find a cheap parking spot.","It's a wide open space of approx. 5 by 20 meters. Many windows and sunshine throughout the day.

The area is upcoming; some of the finest restaurants, bars and clubs on a walking distance, as well a s the quiet of some parks and the Amstel river. It makes the place suitable for both youngster, hipsters and older couples.

The street you will be staying in is a great example of this mixture; up class bakery, next to a coffee shop, a small fast food place and then again a fancy restaurant. It's all here. And it's all peaceful.
 
The east side (' Oost') is also a very diverse part of the city with parks, shops and lots of restaurants and places to go out. The central location makes it really easy to visit the museums and all the good things Amsterdam has to offer.

Subway, tram and railway station are on maximum 5 minute walking distance.



As said earlier; the front room is used by a befriended head- designer. The front room has a private entrance (my house used to be a shop). She does use the kitchen and the toilet. She usually is in for appointments once a week, in the evening but weeks go by without us bumping in to each other and you will most likely not see each other but I do want to mention it. If she has an appointment while you are staying in my place, I will let you know so you won't be caught by surprise.

Please let me know if you have any questions about this, I will be happy to go through the details with you.

 



As a guest you are welcome to use everything available in my place. Of course there is wifi and a washing machine. I don' t have a dish washer so if you hate washing up your coffee cup, it's going  to be a tough stay.

Albert Heijn supermarket is 350 meters away with bike hire right next door. 
You will have all the tourist attractions on your door step, but get the feeling of being a local Amsterdammer! That's what we love.

Metro/Subway:
Weesperplein or Wibaustraat both 350 meters away, 5 minutes to Centraal Station. 
Tram:
300 meters away taking you to the Rijks Museum in 5 minutes. 
Bike Rental:
Next to the Albert Heijn supermarket 350 meters away. 
Walking:
If it is a sunny day just put on comfy shoes and walk the city! It is all so accessible. 25-30 minutes to central station, 15-20 minutes to Rijks museum.

Peaceful location, with silence in the bedrooms at the back of the flat.
The master bedroom has a large skylight with no blind. We will provide eye masks. 
The waste of the flat runs through a newly installed pump. It is very effective and we have never had any problems. NOTHING other than toilet paper can be disposed down the toilets (150 euro fee applies for a call out).
Street Parking available at 32 euro per day","The flat is located on a lovely one way road off the Amstel river with lots of great bars and restaurants locally. 5 min walk to Albert Cuyp market, and close to the city center. 
It is a historic building (monument status), which began as a  bakery in the 1920s and still retains the original front (see photos).
We brought the flat in 2014, and with extensive refurbishment we are delighted with the results. We think it retains it's unique character but has a modern twist that really makes the most of the space.
It's ideal for 2 couples or a family who want to enjoy Amsterdam whilst staying somewhere special.

We love to welcome you in our bright & fully equipped apartment with canal view in the city centre. Have the real Amsterdam experience! 

Quite a few cultural landmarks are at just 5-10 minutes walking distance. Perfect location to explore the city!

What we offer:

•      Our complete & spacious apartment
•      Canal view!
•      Perfect location
•      Fully equipped
•      The real Amsterdam experience!

You will have full access to our bright 2-room apartment with a lovely view on the ‘Nieuwe Prinsengracht’ one of the canals in the centre of Amsterdam. Amsterdam’s 17th-century Canal Ring was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. 

The apartment is situated in the centre of Amsterdam near The Skinny Bridge (Magere brug, at the famous Amstel river). Nice shops, cultural venues and bars/restaurants are at walking distance. 

Our apartment is comfortable and has everything you need for a great stay. Perfect accomodation for couples, and spacious enough for 4 persons!




Our 3th floor apartment was fully renovated in 2013. Enjoy our modern livingroom (high ceilings: spacious and bright). In the livingroom you’ll find the fully equipped open kitchen (stove, oven, microwave, fridge, freezer, Nespresso coffee machine, water cooker and dishwasher).

We offer one bedroom with 1 very comfy double bed. A bathroom with toilet, rainshower and hairdryer. And a sunny relaxroom in the back of our apartment (this room can also be used as an extra bedroom, in that case I'll inflate a comfy aerobed). Fresh bedlinnen, towels and shampoo are provided! A flatscreen TV in the living room and free WIFI are also inclusive.
 



Possibilities to wine and dine are literally just around the corner. And a large supermarket is at just a 5 minutes walk. 
But maybe even more important: A lot of cultural landmarks are at just 5-10 minutes walking distance. For example: the Hermitage, the Rembrandt House, Waterloo Square Market (daily!), the Jewish Historic Museum, the Scheepvaart Museum and the Royal Artis Zoo. 

It’s also very close to the Utrechtsestraat (nice shops, bars and restaurants) and Nieuwmarkt. Nightlife is at a 10 minutes walk at the Rembrandt Square. 

Maybe it’s good to know original Amsterdam Canal houses mostly don’t have a lift, so you get a free exercise and nice view as a reward ;)!

Access from this location is very good. Several trams stop nearby: numbers 7, 10, 14 and 9 are only 5 minutes away. Metro station 'Weesperplein' is also a 5 min. walk! So within 10 minutes you can see all highlights of the city: The Dam, Leidsche Square, Anne Frank House, Red Light District and the famous neighborhood's: The Pijp and the Jordaan. The Rijks Museum, Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk Museum and Museum Square are found within 10 minutes as well. Central Station is also only a 5-minute metro ride from here. 
If you like to ride a bike (which we would recommend  fun and very handy!) there is also a bike rental place close by. No car needed!


Of course we will leave you a map to help you find your way around the city. And tell you all about our favourite spots. 

We're looking forward to welcoming you in our home and offer you a great stay in Amsterdam!

Pets are allowed. Our own cat cube will also be with you during your stay. We only ask that you feed him and clean the litter box. Don't worry about not being home much. He's perfectly happy when he gets fed every morning and evening. There's no need to stay home or something he's used to being alone during the day. You will of course get paid in love and purring kindness.

If you wouldn't like to have him around, just say the word and we will let him stay somewhere else, no problem at all.

Smoking is not allowed inside, though we have a small balcony which is sheltered so you nicotine junkies will be fine.","Lovely, cozy and sunny 1-bedroom apartment with a view of the funky and artsy Nieuwmarkt. Located in the heart of Amsterdam this roomy apartment has everything you'd want.

Located in the heart of Amsterdam this roomy apartment has everything you'd want. Enjoy the perfect location, large living room and exciting neighborhood.

The apartment is 76 m2 and has one master bedroom and one bedroom for a baby or small child. The hall connects to the large living room and kitchen that also gives you acces to the balcony.

The apartment is very cozy and quiet. It has just been redone with a fresh coat of paint on the walls, new doors and a brand new kitchen. The living room is located on the south western side which means a lot of sunlight until late in the evening. It's ideal for couples with children and makes the perfect base to explore the city from.

Although located only a few meters away from the busy centre you are still able to sleep with the window open and enjoy an awesome night's sleep. The apartment has one bedroom with a queen bed and another one with a baby bed. The master bedroom has a large high quality mattress.

The combination of a cozy house right in the middle of one of the places that makes Amsterdam so special is ideal. No doubt that you'll feel at home during your stay.

The actual boss of the house has a passion for cooking so the kitchen is fully equipped up to and including an espresso machine that whips up a cappuccino or latte in an instant. If you feel like staying in and having dinner on your own you will have no problem cooking up something delicious. Of course if you want to go out, there are tons of bars and restaurants around the corner.

In case you bring children (or you're a gamer yourself): the living room hosts a PS4, giving you parents an easy excuse to sleep in a little (or sleep a little less yourself).

Fully equipped kitchen (stove, big fridge, dishwasher, espresso machine), washing machine, 2 televisions.

You'll be met when you arrive and of course be shown around the house. In,case you have any questions you'll be provided with all the contact details. Well try and respond to any question you might have as soon as possible. We aim to make your stay enjoyable so don't hesitate to ask for anything that would make it more so

The Nieuwmarkt, which translates into new market, is one of the busiest and cosiest neighbourhoods in Amsterdam. Although located in the city centre it has the allure of a small village. The neighbors know each other and just walking around is one of the best experiences possible.

Moreover, the neighborhood has one of the best bars in Amsterdam, Stevens, which is right around the corner. You can actually see the bar from the large window in the living room. If you want to do something, having a drink, going out for dinner, the Nieuwmarkt is the place to be.

Next to the apartment are numerous restaurants. One that is worth mentioning is Il Sogno, an Italian store that serves the best pizzas in Amsterdam. Oh and did I mention its located next door!

The appartment is located within walking distance from the central station (around 10 minutes' walk).

You can also choose to take the subway which is only one stop from the central station. The exit to the subway is literally across the road from the appartment making it conveniently located to explore the rest of Amsterdam.

- an 8 minute metro ride to the heart of the city centre
- a train trip to a rich choice of cultural / fun / romantic destinations in the Netherlands
- a convenient variety of shops open till midnight
- a bike rental shop
- a spectacle performed by Dutch people showing their daily routines

The neighborhood is located at the Amstel River and you can find some great restaurants within a 5 minute walk. The famous Restaurant Dauphine is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Make sure you reserve a table before you go. Across from Dauphine you will find the Dutch version of Starbuck’s: The Coffee Company. A hip place to have a laid back coffee. My favorite spot is Riva, this amazingly designed restaurant is located on the shore of the Amstel River and has one of the best outdoor terraces of Amsterdam. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and you want to be early on a sunny day. You just want to spend your whole day on this terrace watching boats passing by while drinking great wines.





Amstel station is one of the hubs in Amsterdam. Get on the train, metro, tram or bus to every corner of the city!","My spacious (85m2), top floor apartment is a hide-away from my hectic international travels. But at the same time, being in the beautiful city of Amsterdam, I want it to be close to where the action happens. 
This apartment offers you both: peaceful surroundings and the proximity of the Amsterdam culture and nightlife . It has everything you'll need for a great stay in a dynamic city. Because it is the top floor, the whole apartment is filled with light. This puts a spotlight on its tasteful interior and spacious character. It is fully equipped with quality utilities to make your stay even more comfortable. 

Since it is a one-bedroom apartment, you will enjoy the comfort the most when staying alone or with two people. The two extra air-beds offer you the possibility to stay in the apartment with maximum 4 people.

Easily accessible by tram & subway. Just two metro stops from central station (where trains go to/from airport). 

Although it's a more quiet part, it's still the city center, where you'll hear cars, construction work, ambulances and people from a nearby pub (weekdays until midnight). The weekend is more quiet as the university (pub) is closed. This is an old house. It has double glass windows, but you can still hear cars passing by. The ceiling is not well isolated which means you can sometimes hear the neighbor walking around.

I will be available (by phone or IRL) for tips on where to eat, drink, what to visit, where to go, but only if you want to.

The apartment is located in the city centre, but the feel (quiet, safe, spacious) is more Oost (East). It's close to practically everyting. 

If you're into raw, young & industrial there's the Wibautstraat and Amsterdam Noord (free ferry from the Central Station)

For some good shopping the Utrechtsestraat is a good place to start. 

Museums are also very near. The Hermitage, Joods Historisch Museum, Stedelijk. Or visit a concert in concert hall Paradiso (former church).

If you're more into discovering upcoming neighbourhoods you can eat your heart out in multicultural Oost. Bars, restaurants, parks, it's filled with it.

The famous zoo Artis is nice too! It a 5 minutes walk, and you could start your day with a great coffee and breakfast at 'T', which is just downtairs around the corner.

Kriterion is an arty cinema/bar with a young student public.

See my guide for the exact locations!

Many museums and good places are in walking distance.
You can get everywhere in the city in a few minutes by public transit.
All the metro's, many tram connections and a train station are literally around the corner. 
You can also use my bike, to feel like a true Amsterdammer :)

It's 25 minutes by train from the airport.

Finding a parking spot is easy, but expensive.

There's no elevator & the stairs are steep and quite narrow. Workout!! Also, I don't have a tv  (iPad with Netflix anailable though)

There won't be a sleeping place available on the boat.

The apartment is located on the first floor of the building, allowing spectacular views from the living room. This location places the property right in the heart of Amsterdam’s Unesco World Heritage site, yet meters away from “the Pijp”, a neighborhood famous for it’s bars, cafes and restaurants, as well as the city’s biggest market.

The apartment is situated right in between the glamorous Royal Theater – “Carré”  – and the exclusive “Amstel hotel”. A little further along is the romantic “Magere Brug” (Skinny Bridge), the “Hermitage Museum” and the Opera house (“Het Muziektheater”).

You can wake up in the morning and take in the views with a cup of coffee on one of the balconies, before popping into a neighborhood bakery for breakfast croissants. In the evening, stroll along to one of the many nearby restaurants, before enjoying a drink at a typical Amsterdam “bruin café”.

Walk just 300 meters, and you can find yourself on the “Utrechtsestraat”, renowned for its many restaurants, cafes, designer boutiques, lovely bakeries and wine shops. The local feel of the Utrechtsestraat makes it an excellent option for tourists who want to become “Amsterdammers” (even if only for a couple of days). Plus, it’s a prime spot for hunting out the best and most original gifts to take back home. For the partygoers, popular Rembrandt Square is only 700 meters away.

For exploring further a field, there is a tram stop just 50 meters away, with a direct line to the Museum Quarter (Rijksmuseum, Stedelijk Museum and Van Gogh Museum). And just 250 meters away, there is a metro/underground station “Weesperplein”, which is only 2 short stops away from the Central Train Station or Amstel Train Station.From there direct trains to: Schiphol AMS Airport, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Antwerp, Paris.

We built our boat in 2003. It consists of a wooden house on a steel barge.
The houseboat is situated in the Plantage neighborhood in the historical center of Amsterdam.
At the end of the canal is the Amstel river and the Magere Bridge.
Living on a boat will bring you in contact with Nature in the city: swans, ducks and other birds come to the kitchen window to check if there is something to eat.
In the morning you can hear the sound of the water against the boat as other boats and canoes come past. 
In Spring and Summer there are always boats passing on the canal enjoying Amsterdam from the water.
The light from the water mirrors beautifully in the boat.
In the middle of the boat there is a cabin, with windows all around, letting natural light flood in and brightening up the houseboat.
The surface is approximately 58 m2, and designed to be compact but comfortable.
The entrance is into the open plan kitchen, dining- and living room.
The kitchen is basic, but well equipped.
There is a 2m long table and a comfortable couch. A flat screen television and WIFI are available.
The bathroom is compact with a hot and powerful shower. 
There is a main bedroom with a queen size bed, one bedroom, with lovely large windows, which has a single bed and also a cabin with a single bed.
The houseboat is moored directly to the side of the canal, has it's own direct entrance, and bicycles can be placed on the gangway.
Although the boat does not have an outside sitting area, there is a large door that opens directly onto the water, which is ideal with nice weather.
The boat is close to a Metro station, only 3 stops from Central Station, from where Schiphol can easily be reached by train.
There are museums, trams, shops, nice cafés, restaurants and the zoo within walking distance from the houseboat.
Renting a bike is also possible.

Location

Your apartment is located on the banks of the Amstel River. This river runs through the city of Amsterdam and the Amstel River has the same feeling for Amsterdam like the Seine has for Paris. The banks of the Amstel provide a great place for a walk or to get a cold Amstel beer at the cozy bar next door. The Hermitage, The Stopera city hall and opera house and Carre Theatre are all located on the banks of the river.

It will only take you a 3 minute walk to visit the Hermitage. The Hermitage Amsterdam is managed by the Dutch Stichting Hermitage aan de Amstel and shows art from the collection of the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg.  

Located next to The Hermitage is the Opera (Stopera) House. This is a building complex, housing both the City Hall and the Muziektheater, the principal opera house of Amsterdam and is the home of the National Dutch Opera, Ballet and Symphony. 

Next to the Stopera is the Jewish Resistance monument. This monument is dedicated to the Jewish victims during the Second World War. On the corner at the Stopera you will find the metro stop ‘Waterlooplein’, which will take you to Central Station in 2 stops /5 minutes

If you step out of the apartment to the right, you arrive at the beautiful Carre theatre in just 500 meters.

In front of your doorstep, the well-known Magere Brug (skinny bridge)  crosses the Amstel River and you enter the Kerkstraat and 500 meters further you arrive at Utrechtse Straat ((URL HIDDEN) This is where locals hang out: Nice boutique style shops, have a breakfast, lunch or dinner or just a drink in the evening in one of many nice bars and restaurants...

From the house, you can actually see the towers of RijksMuseum, at 2km’s.

Visit the Dam, at 2,5km’s, the heart of Amsterdam: This large square used to be the place for the hippies in the sixties and seventies. Around this square you can spot the Royal Palace. You will also enjoy the begging pigeons which use this square as their basis to get food.

And if you get lost? just ask anyone in Amsterdam for the Skinny Bridge...they know..

The distance from the apartment to several highlights:
* Jewish museum 300 m
* Hermitage: 300 m
* Carre Theatre 300 m
* Waterlooplein / Stopera: 400 m
* Artis Zoo: 1,5 km
* Rijksmuseum 2 km
* Dam square 2,5 km

Metro station Waterlooplein (only 2 stops from Central Station and a direct stop from Park&Ride) is at 5 minutes walk. You also can find Tram lines nearby.

Skinny Bridge

One of Amsterdam’s many bridges is the beautiful Magere Brug (Skinny Bridge). This wooden drawbridge was once so narrow that it was hard for two pedestrians to pass each other. To cope with increasing traffic on the Amstel, a wider bridge replaced the narrow original in 1871.
Skinny sisters 
There is a local legend that the bridge was named after the “magere zussen” (skinny sisters). These two well-off sisters lived on opposite sides of the river. They are said to have had the wooden bridge built to make it easier to visit one another. 

Romantic bridge 
In the evenings, the charming Magere Brug is very popular with couples and photographers. Thousands of lights romantically illuminate it at night, making the Magere Brug one of the most beautiful bridges in Amsterdam.","Welcome to our luxurious, two bedroom Skinny Bridge canal house apartment Amsterdam

I'm an historian and a former writer for Amsterdam's largest historical publication. I am easily persuaded to share my knowledge and love for the city on a little city walk!

The neighbourhood is residential, urban. Mostly early 1900's 'Brick Expressionism', typical Dutch architecture.

Right next to the metroline into the city. Four minutes to the Red Light district, six to Central Station.

Dappermarkt is one of the country’s oldest - and best - outdoor markets. It forms the multicultural heart of the neighbourhood along with such major arteries as Javastraat, which once only provided every manner of global grocery but is now beginning to feature more upscale cafes and terraces. One of the city’s largest general hospitals, OLVG, is also located here. Two stellar city parks, Oosterpark and Flevopark, provide quick escape from the relatively busy streets. Besides many cheap ethnic eateries and supermarkets, the area is attracting much more higher-end cafes and restaurants who are often re-inventing many of the area’s industrial monuments. On sunny days, the parks and terraces are filled with nice people.

I have a great list of my favorite places in Amsterdam which I'll share with you once you booked. Happy to help out with questions you might have about the city as well.

This is the hot neighborhood in Amsterdam under the Dutch working population (28 - 38 yrs). A lot of new nice bars, coffee places and restaurants have opened here in the past few years. With a bike on your side all parts of Amsterdam can be reached in max 15 minutes (the good parts between 0 and 8 minutes).

The subway is around the corner which takes you straight to Central station or the RAI (or Arena for soccer fans). Furthermore Amsterdam is about biking. You can rent a bike for around 7 eur per day which is recommended. The bike store is very close to the apartment.

The apartment is on the first floor of the building and has it's own 'rooftop' terrace (also on the first floor), which is quite unique for an apartment that is not on the top floor.","Welcome to Amsterdam!

Two bedrooms, one master bedroom with Kingsize bed, and one large 30m2 bedroom which our 4 kids use - 1 bunkbed for 3 and 1 comfy bed-sofa for 2.

We will await you when you arrive, and show you everything in the apartment, after that the place is all yours.

The Nieuwmarket area is one of the most popular neighbourhoods in town. Next to the Red Light district and China Town, 5 minutes from central station and 15 minutes from the big museums. There is a metro station across the house so you have easy access to the whole city. This neighbourhood has plenty of nice restaurants & bars and shops nearby.  Waterloo Market is 5 minutes away.  Please look on the internet there is plenty to do & see!

There is a metro station 500 meters from the house, Central station is 10-15 minutes walk, the nearest tram station is 5-10 minutes walk.

My place is a wonderful one-bedroom apartment right in the heart of the Red Light District. It is clean and minimal, perfect for guests.

I have a large front room that includes the kitchen and living room and a spectacular view of Amsterdam's most unique canal. The bathroom is also minimal and clean, complete with a shower (no bath). The sleeping quarters are also spacious and comfortable.

On most occasions, I will greet the guests. In rare instances I will have another person welcome you to the apartment. Because of this, I need to have accurate arrival times from any guests. This makes it easier for everyone involved.

This is the oldest and most interesting area of Amsterdam. There is no shortage of culture, food, entertainment or good people. When you tire of it, you are close to other gorgeous neighborhoods that host various cultural and nightlife options. The city can be traversed easily by foot. The more adventurous will definitely rent a bike and experience the best urban biking infrastructure in the world.

Amsterdam is a wonderfully planned city. Whether walking, biking or riding public transportation you will have no problems getting  around.

As this is my home I do screen my guests. I am not looking for stag parties or people coming strictly for revelry; to these people, respectfully, please look elsewhere. I prefer couples and single travelers. 

Do not let this caveat scare you. I am very easy-going and fun, however the Red Light District does attract many questionable characters and I do not want these sort of people staying in my home. A preemptive thanks for understanding.","My place is a wonderful one-bedroom apartment right in the heart of the Red Light District. It is clean and minimal, perfect for guests.

I couldn't think of a better area to live in Amsterdam. It is a quiet residential area, yet within 500m you will find bars, cafes, restaurants, supermarkets, a movie theater, the Zoo and a university campus.

The subway is just around the corner, so its very easy to reach the Central Sation (or Amstel Sation).

I would love to share with you all the secrets of Amsterdam: nice spots to eat, small lovely museums or biking/jogging-trails outside Amsterdam.

I am sure you will love my house as much as I do!",

On a good day there will be a lot of boats active on the water and you'll feel you are at the most central point of Amsterdam. Living on a boat like this gives you all the comfort (central heating, airconditioning, cable tv, et cetera), but also a feeling best described as 'freedom'. The boat is fixed of course, but the slight movements give you the feeling you are not attached to the rest of the world.

Being as much central as you can get there is A LOT to do in the neighbourhood. The Utrechtsestraat with the best restaurants, Rembrandt square entertainment area, Waterloo square flee market, Nieuwmarkt cafés, red ligth district, Hermitage museum (with temporarily also the Van Gogh Museum), the Rembrandt house, et cetera - everything is there! Especially nice is a great store open from 8 in the morning to 2 in the night.

If for some reason you want to visit other areas in the city, the metro and tram are just a few steps away (subway services 51, 53 and 54, trams 9 and 14, nightbuses 357, 359, 361 and 363). Amsterdam Central station takes about 3 minutes and the tram takes you in just a few minutes to the Jordaan or in the other direction Artis ZOO.

Extra options are breakfast, fill-the-fridge, a private boat tour and a parking space. Hope to welcome you soon!","You enter the houseboat from the square directly in front of the 'Stopera'. Down about 5 steps you can go left to a small bedroom (sleeps 2), straight ahead to the rather large bathroom with toilet, seperate bath and shower. If you go right you enter the fully equipped kitchen and the living room. At the dining table you can sit and enjoy the view over the most central bit of the river Amstel. Of course there is also a comfortable couch and a sofa-bed to sleep 2. From the living room you enter the master bedroom with a nice double bed.

Garbage: Amsterdam city has containers placed underground in each street. If you exit the apartment, the closest one is 30 meters to your right (it's a small green box you can open).

Built during the city’s Golden Age, the three parallel canals are interconnected with streets filled with shopping, eating and drinking opportunities. The Canal Ring is made up of Herengracht, Keizersgracht and Prinsengracht. In a way, the Canal Ring forms a crossover from the more bustling Centre to the gentler outer neighbourhoods of Jordaan, Museum District and De Pijp. The Canal Ring includes the city’s two main nightlife and culture squares. Leidseplein features such legendary concert halls as Paradiso and Melkweg. Rembrandtplein has several bars, two large nightclubs (Escape and Air), and ‘old world’ evocative treasures such as De Kroon and Café Schiller. The whole area is dotted with Amsterdam's beloved neighbourhood ‘brown cafes'.

The apartment is just over 100m2, so quite spacious for two. It covers two floors and is part of an apartment complex with a shared stairway leading to the apartments. It has a private terrace next to the apartment, and also two balconies. All of them have sunlight more or less throughout the day/evening.
The complex is build during the initial build of the southern part of Transvaalbuurt somewhere during the 1930ties. It has a couple of authentic details like a bay window for instance.

You can access all rooms. However in the walk-in closet is nothing to find, so walking around is okay, but you can't use anything in there.

I'll be available via telephone or e-mail.

You can best take a train, tram, bus or underground to the Amstel Station or Wibautstraat Station. It's a short walk from there (aprox. 10min.).
Getting to the city can be done by bike (you can rent bikes through the whole of Amsterdam). By bike it's about 10 minutes to get to the city centre stuff. Also you can take the underground from Amstel Station or Wibautstraat Station. Both are 5-10 minute walk.
Taking the bus or tram to any where can be done from Amstel Station or Beukenplein (square).

>> Mind you: our lovely place is in the final stage of a rebuild. We feel it's 99% finished, so very well liveable and enjoyable, however some things are not yet done. I'll outline that in detail further down below.
- Not all areas have doors
- Some lighting is yet to be installed, however in all areas is a way to activate a (standing) lamp.","The apartment is just over 100m2, so quite spacious for two.

Without any doubt this is the best location in Amsterdam for a houseboat: in the heart of the city on the sunny side of the Amstel River next to the ‘Skinny Bridge’ and the Royal theater Carré. The 'Skinny Bridge Boat' has completely been refurnished in 2012 giving guests the best facilities possible while keeping the authentic characteristics of the boat. Pure Vintage! Make yourself a coffee from fresh beans, relax on the Italian design couch, feel well rested after a night on the Eastborn boxspring, but most of all enjoy the fantastic view this place in Amsterdam offers. On several places you can sit outside on the deck, enjoy breakfast and the view on the lively Amstel. And since the best way to discover Amsterdam is from the waterside: just take the motorboat that is available for you (max. 6 persons) for a spin in the city and enjoy your own private canal cruise anytime you like (boat available from May till October).
 
This houseboat is very spacious with two bedrooms, two bathrooms (1 large one with both a bath and a shower) two toilets and a large living room with sleeping couch.

One of the bedrooms is located in the ol' captains den making it a very charming room. Walking outside over the gangway you reach this romantic suite. After having taken a bath in the classical bathtub you can go upstairs for a great view (with a cup of coffee or tea) from the place where the captain used to steer the boat.
 
The 'Skinny Bridge Boat' is the answer to an exclusive stay in Amsterdam. Even though it is situated in the heart of the city were the river is lively during the day, the nights are very quite. Only on a few occasions there are exceptions: on Queensday, during the Gay Parade (which passes in front of the boat) and when on May 5th, a part of the Amstel River changes into a podium for the Queen and visitors for an open air concert: Be quick if you want a free ticket on the first row!

The apartment is located alongside a small canal, in a lovely quiet street with broad pavements and cute front gardens. The apartment is very spacious. The large open-plan living space has a comfortable seating area, a large kitchen and a great sunny eating area. The luxurious kitchen has a dishwasher, a microwave, oven, induction cooker and a tap that provides hot, cold and boiling water. It provides everything you need to cook and bake, including a kitchenaid and blender.
There are three bedrooms. A large children's bedroom with a single bed (and a small toddler mattress), a large bedroom with a double bed, and a smaller playroom/guestroom with a double bed. There is a bathroom with a toilet, bath, double sink, and rain-shower. There is also an additional separate toilet.
The garden has a comfortable seating area, and lots of room to play. There is a big swing and a small trampoline. 
We have two children (2 and 4 years) so there are lots of toys.

Everything in the apartment is available for your use (except for one room where we will stash all of our messy mess). In addition, you can relax in the back garden, or you can have breakfast or a glass of wine in our front garden, overlooking the canal.

We only rent out our house when we are traveling ourselves, so we will not be there during your stay. However, we always make sure that there is a friend nearby if anything comes up, and you can always reach us by phone or email.

Our neighbourhood, Amsterdam East, is great! It is green and quiet and residential, but there ample restaurants (We love De vergulde eenhoorn, which is just across the water) and shops (Supermarkets and even small shopping centre, Oostpoort) at a few minutes walking distance.

The public transport connections are great. Amstel train station is 10 minutes walking from our door. You can also get on the subway there (which will take you to the city centre in 5 minutes). The bus stops around the corner, and the tram-stop where the tram can take you directly to museum square is 10 minutes away.

We live in a great neighbourhood, but it is a residential neighbourhood. So, this is definitely NOT a partyhouse. Some of uur neighbours are elderly, others have a tiny baby, and they all enjoy their quiet nights. And we really respect that, and we would like you to feel the same way. Our house is very suitable for families, or couples looking for a quiet and comfortable place to explore all the joys that Amsterdam has to offer. 

We do not accommodate groups where more than 2 people are between 18 and 28 years old.","The apartment is located alongside a small canal, in a lovely quiet street with broad pavements and cute front gardens.

Dappermarkt is one of the country’s oldest - and best - outdoor markets. It forms the multicultural heart of the neighbourhood along with such major arteries as Javastraat, which once only provided every manner of global grocery but is now beginning to feature more upscale cafes and terraces. One of the city’s largest general hospitals, OLVG, is also located here. Two stellar city parks, Oosterpark and Flevopark, provide quick escape from the relatively busy streets. Besides many cheap ethnic eateries and supermarkets, the area is attracting much more higher-end cafes and restaurants who are often re-inventing many of the area’s industrial monuments. On sunny days, the parks and terraces are filled with nice people.

Canal Belt / Centre of Amsterdam

The history of Amsterdam is intimately connected with water. Its 165 canals were created over the centuries to stimulate trade and transport and reclaim land to expand the city. The four main canals, which determine the image of the center of Amsterdam, are Singel, Herengracht, Keizersgracht and Prinsengracht. The canal belt is a system of streets, quays, bridges and houses which are built on identical plots of equal length and width. In between you can find closed courtyards. On the outside of this beautiful canal houses you can read the prosperity that characterized the Golden Age and the 18th century. Since many buildings are renovated in the course of time, the buildings vary in terms of architectural styles and beautiful facades, which creates a characteristic appearance. The famous canals have been a tourist attraction for many years, which resulted in the fact that they are found on the World Heritage List of UNESCO since 2010.
Besides providing a stunning backdrop to the city’s historical centre, floating down Amsterdam’s canals is one of the most memorable ways to discover the city. Whether you’re a first-time or frequent visitor, everything in Amsterdam seems a bit more magical when viewed from a boat.
In the intervening streets you can find many small bars, restaurants and boutiques. A lovely place to spend an afternoon. Here you will also find the shopping area 'The Nine Streets', which includes leading stores of big brands, but also the small exclusive shops. In addition, many crafts are located here, such as butchers and bakers. The canal belt is the center of Amsterdam, this puts you within walking distance of many tourist attractions such as the Anne Frank House, Rembrandt Square, Leidseplein, Museumplein, Dam Square and the Royal Palace and the shopping areas around the Utrechtsestraat and Kalverstraat.","This bed and breakfast on a houseboat reflects the ultimate Amsterdam experience.

INNER CITY DESIGN CANAL VIEW APARTMENT. Visit Amsterdam in style, enjoy this modern place in a historical building centrally located overlooking the beautiful Kloveniersburgwal canal.

The apartment is situated only a few minutes walk from Dam Square (Royal Palace), right opposite the Royal Academy of Sciences --- and if Science is not your thing, it's a few blocks away from the Flower Market, the Nieuwmarkt, the Red Light District and Rembrandt Square... Leidseplein is 15 minutes by foot. Views: on the canal, on the Zuiderkerk (Southern Church) and the Oude Kerk (Old Church) across a silent little courtyard.
The open-plan apartment measures over 70 metres (about 800 sq feet), consists of a glass-secluded area with transparent doors and high (3m, 9 feet) ceilings; the apartment is fully furnished.
My spacious studio is  really nice: renovated under prize winning architect's design supervision, all elements handmade and custom-designed.

Finding a parking is not easy in Amsterdam centre (and not cheap). Bikes can be rented everywhere and walking brings you everywhere interesting in 5, sometimes 10 minutes.

Please note: there is a coffeeshop quite close to the apartment. No sound or smell issues. For some extra convenience, for some maybe not so good.

However, if you plan to come by car, there is a possibility to leave it at a P+R parking house. Will supply you with more info, if needed.

I am more than happy to give you any tips to make your stay as good as possible! Being that public transport info, restaurants/bars for foodies, bike rentals etc., no need to hold back!

Located in near Amstel river, Oosterpark and lovely Park Frankendael, with only a 15 min bike ride to Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam Centraal or the canals. The vicinity of Amstel Station makes it easily accessible to all other parts of town, if not fond or afraid of biking with the locals.

Great coffee places (Bar Bukowski!) and food points in the surroundings, especially down Amstel river towards the centre and the National Opera. Troppen museum and the beautiful botanical garden also very close and easy to reach. However, the more east you go, the more multi-cultural it gets, which means a lot of restaurants from different nationalities, Turkish, Indonesian etc., as well as a lot of nice places near the water (for e.g. Roest - my favourite!). Food stores just around the corner (Lidl).

Very easy to access - Amstel Station is only 5 min walk away, from where you can take any means of transport within the city or to Schiphol (30 min by public transport). If courageous enough to use a bike, it is very easy to find your way back home - just follow the river!","The apartment has approx. 30m2 big, is very sunlight (in the morning you can watch the sunrise!), open and noise-free. It has a single bed and a two-person air mattress, if needed for the second guest, own kitchen and own bathroom with a shower.

Amsterdam East is rising as a trendy neighborhood, still 'safe' from the touristy crowds of the center. 

At the lively Beukenplein (around the corner) try some delicious Thai cuisine, shop for the best wine and cheese in town at Erik's Delicatessen, have a flower-drawn cappuccino at Koffee Bru or send your postcards from the post office. For a 360° view of Amsterdam, a meal, a drink or live music, go to restaurant/club Canvas on the rooftop terrace of the Volkshotel, a three-minute walk from our place. 

Go jogging at the nearby Oosterpark, a beautiful park that houses the Tropen Museum, one of Europe’s leading ethnographic museums. The permanent and temporary exhibitions display (art) objects, photographs, music and film from non-western cultures. We love their interactive exhibitions and programs for children of 6 to 13 years of age.
