I will do my best to make your stay as comfortable as possible, so you can enjoy Amsterdam to the fullest. I live in the apartment above so don't hesitate to ask for anything.  I'll always try to help.
My study demands a lot of time, so it is impossible to handle everything from the apartment myself. I arranged my friend Guido to handle the check-ins. He's currently applying for a musical theater school and is doing some theater projects as well.

I had a lot of fun with those  very special guests, artists, business men, we all had a wonderful time. In 1998 I sold La Casalo, it was a hard decision, but I needed my freedom back! And ..I got it and enjoy every minute of life, making music , fooling around with my small grand childs , sailing and our holidays in Bretagne,You may know that my ""luxe"" is nature and love , for me Luxe has nothing to do with money or glamour.

A born and raised Amsterdam city girl.
This lovely low- maintenance city is a metropole within a village; it combines the thrill and diversity of serious metropoles with the cosy and safe qualities of a village. It's the kind of city of love and it's the kind of person I am; I love the thrill and the quiet. 

I have always been fascinated by storytelling and political campaigning and managed to make a living out of this fascination. I have been working in the field of politics and campaigning for many years now and I was involved in legalizing airbnb in Amsterdam recently, a great project to work on for the city.

Furthermore I love cinema, basketball, cooking, dining, wine, springtime and long walks. With the ones I love, of course. 

I started booking with airbnb 3 years ago and knowing the joy of staying in a great and homy place only recently (May 2014) decided to be part of the sharing economy all the way and share my place and knowledge of this city with like minded travelers around the world. I really do believe the sharing experience ads to the any stay, anywhere.

Thanks for your interest in our cosy appartment.

I'm a photographer, location scout/manager, creative director and internet entrepreneur.

I live on the Amstel for 8 years. First we lived at a real boat, a sailing ship. We were in love of this place because of the oase of peace & nature in the middle of the city. But because of kids coming the ship became too small for 2 kids, so we started to realise an ark, this took about 1,5 year. On the 1st birthday of our daugther Luca this Ark was shipped to this place and still we are enjoying and we even love this place more and more. 
I am a personal life coach, trainer and freelance project manager. My passion is to create indivudual, and social changes.

Together we love to take care of people and making sure they have a wonderful stay. We know al the ins and outs about our city, where to go for the best art from the golden age to the newest bars in town. Where to go to for your perfect Amsterdam biking experience and where the secret swimming spots are for the summer. From the best dutch apple pie to the famous chinese oysters of Nam Kee.

Red light district is a one of a kind neighborhood, there is never a dull moment. But if you want to look beyond the tourist point of few ask us for the alternative guide to the red light district, with design shops bars game halls great coffee and cakes.


We hope you will love our city as much as we do.

We are Bas and Mirte, around 30 yrs old and we live in Amsterdam. We live here with our little baby girl Lilly, born in May 2015.
Our motto for life is work hard, play hard: Mirte is a marketing manager in FMCG and Bas is account manager in the rail and infrastructure industry. Enough about work; we both love to travel, far away or closeby, our last vacation was to Cuba in December '14. Bas loves paragliding and visits the beach and dunes at least once a week to fly; even more he loves paragliding in the Alps, so if he's not enjoying Amsterdam; chances are you'll find him in Austria. I myself love cooking, running (great combination ;-)), shopping and reading. And I hate how boring my life looks compared to Bas' ;-). 
Oh and we do have other things in common, we both love watching movies and series!

Thank you for your interest in my profile.

For the last 15 years I have lived in Amsterdam in many different parts of the city. For the last 5 years I've had the luck of living in this cosy apartment, right in the middle of everything!

Because I love traveling as much as you do and because I really like to meet people from all over the world, it will be great to share with you and offer you my hospitality and knowledge of the city and surroundings.

I really like cooking and baking and good food, so you can ask me about a wide variety of restaurants and cafe's. If the time is right, who knows, maybe we will even share a meal and a glass of wine or go on a stroll in Amsterdam!

There is so much to do and see in Amsterdam to keep you entertained. But!: The Netherlands has so much more to offer than just Amsterdam; so if you enjoy cycling, kayaking or hiking in nature, visit a museum or cultural event or whatever rows your boat, you are most welcome to ask me about what do see and do in the rest of our little country and how to get there.
It will be my pleasure to share everything I know!

Hopefully I will be able to welcome you soon.

Kind regards

Besides Amsterdam, we love to travel to sunny places or go for a ski in the winter. Last December we traveled for the first time with AirBnb when we celebrated our anniversary in New York. We loved the experience and enjoy meeting people that love to travel as much as we do. Hopefully our houseboat can be the perfect home for you to experience Amsterdam in a unique way!
