Our mother always told us: sharing is caring so we decided to share our home with the visitors of Amsterdam. 

We are putting our home on airbnb because we want to share the authentic experience of living on a housebout with travelers from all across the world.  We ourselves have travelled across to globe to numerous destinations and our favourite places to stay were not the big hotels but rather something homely. We cherished the opportunity to stay at locations that were similar as to how the local population lived. From Australia to Cuba nothing beats escaping the hordes of tourists and mingling with the locals. And that is exactly what we provide here on our houseboat.

With our dog, a very enjoyable sweet little bastard, we are THE  happy family ! In 1992 I build the very first floating hotel in Amsterdam ""La Casalo""which was known world wide because  is was so personal and so different. Only 4 rooms which made it possible to have a deeper contact with the guests. That such a small hotel would attract celebrities looking for privacy  was a happy suprise to me. I had a lot of fun with those  very special guests, artists, business men, we all had a wonderful time. In 1998 I sold La Casalo, it was a hard decision, but I needed my freedom back! And ..I got it and enjoy every minute of life, making music , fooling around with my small grand childs , sailing and our holidays in Bretagne,You may know that my ""luxe"" is nature and love , for me Luxe has nothing to do with money or glamour. I prefer staying in a little chalet or a mobilhome than in a big hotel with Jaccuzzi! Nature around my boat is something special in the middle of city life.

A born and raised Amsterdam city girl.
This lovely low- maintenance city is a metropole within a village; it combines the thrill and diversity of serious metropoles with the cosy and safe qualities of a village. It's the kind of city of love and it's the kind of person I am; I love the thrill and the quiet. 

I have always been fascinated by storytelling and political campaigning and managed to make a living out of this fascination. I have been working in the field of politics and campaigning for many years now and I was involved in legalizing airbnb in Amsterdam recently, a great project to work on for the city.

Furthermore I love cinema, basketball, cooking, dining, wine, springtime and long walks. With the ones I love, of course. 

I started booking with airbnb 3 years ago and knowing the joy of staying in a great and homy place only recently (May 2014) decided to be part of the sharing economy all the way and share my place and knowledge of this city with like minded travelers around the world. I really do believe the sharing experience ads to the any stay, anywhere.

But because of kids coming the ship became too small for 2 kids, so we started to realise an ark, this took about 1,5 year.

We are now living in Amsterdam and working as independent check-in managers for owners and landlords.

“Si si claro” means “yes of course!” in Spanish, and was the name of our Bed & Breakfast in Barcelona. This B&B – since 2010 – was located in our own home. That’s when we learned how valuable it is to have a trustworthy person taking care of your home and guests when travelling. Since 2013 we take care of the home and guests of others in Amsterdam.

We strongly believe the mix of outstanding hospitality, personal attention and accurate guest selection is the key to successful short term rental of your home.

A little description about myself (Luis).... I am Argentinian, an outgoing person, when I have some free time i like to take my car and go out to the mountains to enjoy the nature and relax.

I love my family, my son Max and friends, and of course a good BBQ :-) 

We wish you a great time in this beautiful city Amsterdam and we will  make you feel like home even if you are far from your first home ;-)

But because of kids coming the ship became too small for 2 kids, so we started to realise an ark, this took about 1,5 year.

We are three young individuals who started a B&B together.
Rose, loves to read books, might be the reason why she studies Literature. 
Anjo, finished his bachelor in Psycology, lives in Leuven Belgium.
Mirre, is an Art and theatre fanatic, studied theatre and at the moment she studies fine art and design.
Together we love to take care of people and making sure they have a wonderful stay. We know al the ins and outs about our city, where to go for the best art from the golden age to the newest bars in town. Where to go to for your perfect Amsterdam biking experience and where the secret swimming spots are for the summer. From the best dutch apple pie to the famous chinese oysters of Nam Kee.

Red light district is a one of a kind neighborhood, there is never a dull moment. But if you want to look beyond the tourist point of few ask us for the alternative guide to the red light district, with design shops bars game halls great coffee and cakes.


We hope you will love our city as much as we do.

Enjoy

With a lot of care, love and TIME! I have turned 2 rooms into a beautiful B&B. It is modern and industrial with a classic touch and new combined with old, secondhand, selfmade furniture, bricabrac and other details. 


I call my B&B beautiful not only because i think it is so ( I did it all myself with friends and must say we did a PRETTY good job here!) 
I bought beautiful things, in different countries and some Redisigncled ;-), with love... 
And if you like something as much as I do, you can buy it! because a lot of my beautiful things are for sale.

I believe in beauty in many ways, I like it that I am not in a very fancy, expencive and obviosly also beautiful, neighbourhood. 
But in a multicultural one that has it's own beauties and many of them. 
Also I like working with different materials, wood , fabic, stone, witch all have a beautiful structure of there own. 
I love the beatiful trees in my street for as the street it self isn't that nice, love that contrast. The big older concreet buildings around the corner of my street, witch a lot of people think are ugly but I think they are beautiful and now even more so because they all have a new destination, so you can go visite them, to enjoy a drink or meal and have a beautiful time in a beautiful environment. 
And last but not least; I want everyone to have a beautiful time in my B&B and beautiful Amsterdam and I wil do my best to make your stay as beautiful as possible."

We are Bas and Mirte, around 30 yrs old and we live in Amsterdam. We live here with our little baby girl Lilly, born in May 2015.
Our motto for life is work hard, play hard: Mirte is a marketing manager in FMCG and Bas is account manager in the rail and infrastructure industry. Enough about work; we both love to travel, far away or closeby, our last vacation was to Cuba in December '14. Bas loves paragliding and visits the beach and dunes at least once a week to fly; even more he loves paragliding in the Alps, so if he's not enjoying Amsterdam; chances are you'll find him in Austria. I myself love cooking, running (great combination ;-)), shopping and reading. And I hate how boring my life looks compared to Bas' ;-). 
Oh and we do have other things in common, we both love watching movies and series!

Thank you for your interest in my profile.

For the last 15 years I have lived in Amsterdam in many different parts of the city. For the last 5 years I've had the luck of living in this cosy apartment, right in the middle of everything!

Because I love traveling as much as you do and because I really like to meet people from all over the world, it will be great to share with you and offer you my hospitality and knowledge of the city and surroundings.

I really like cooking and baking and good food, so you can ask me about a wide variety of restaurants and cafe's. If the time is right, who knows, maybe we will even share a meal and a glass of wine or go on a stroll in Amsterdam!

There is so much to do and see in Amsterdam to keep you entertained. But!: The Netherlands has so much more to offer than just Amsterdam; so if you enjoy cycling, kayaking or hiking in nature, visit a museum or cultural event or whatever rows your boat, you are most welcome to ask me about what do see and do in the rest of our little country and how to get there.
It will be my pleasure to share everything I know!

Hopefully I will be able to welcome you soon.

Kind regards
