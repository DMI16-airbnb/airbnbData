Located in the center on the top floor with views over the city and the Zuiderkerk tower, our historic place is in the middle of it all, yet surprisingly quiet. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!\n\nThe apartment is the top of a historic building in what was once the Jewish Quarter. Though everything has been renewed, antique elements such as the starts, railing, and beams lend immense charm. The tall ceilings make it feel spacious, and the windows let in plenty of light, especially in the morning as the sun rises through the main room windows!\n\nThe red light district is one bridge away, but there are also other fantastic places to explore in the Jewish District, as well as on the Nieuwmarkt.\n\nJust a 10 minute walk from Central Station, or one metro stop, our place is located just outside the Nieuwe Hoogstraat metro, which connects you in minutes to all the other train stations in Amsterdam. Because of its central location, parking is very difficult, however, and it not recommended!\n\nThe building does not have a lift, so be sure to have strong legs to climb the 4 stories to the top!
