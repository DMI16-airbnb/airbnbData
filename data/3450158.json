So I am offering my boat and me as caption to anyone who would like to have a great time on the water/canals. \n\nThe price will be:\nPer hour - 45 euro \n\n\n\nBring your own drinks and food. There will be music on board. \n\nI love to interact with my guests. So if you want to see Amsterdam by boat and like to have me as captain let me know. \n\nDepends on the time we have but seeing the canals in Amsterdam takes an hour or two. The boat is strong enough to leave the canals but it all depends what the weather is.\n\nThe boat is in City Center (near Nieuwmarkt).
