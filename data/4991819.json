She was so welcoming, kind, and helpful whenever we needed information. She will make you feel just like at home. Concerning the appartement, the neighborhood is really well located. You will find a lot of places to eat and nice bar to have a drink. It's located just near by the canals at less than a minute which is perfect. There was a metro station at 2 minutes walking from the house. The room was spacious and clean and the building was lovely as well as the street. During your stay you will have access to everything. We even had a little balcony which was very pleasant, you can eat the breakfast on it it's nice.\r\n\r\nWe had a perfect experience at Julia's and we really recommend her appartement.","created_at":"2016-06-01T00:56:32Z","id":77356785,"listing_id":4991819,"reviewee_id":14568685,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Emma","has_profile_pic":true,"id":67717248,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/e38adaa9-ed68-42ff-a867-fefc9ab4f354.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/e38adaa9-ed68-42ff-a867-fefc9ab4f354.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":67717248,"role":"guest"}},"toto_opt_in":null,"wireless_info":null,"listing_occupancy_info":{"show_occupancy_message":true},"review_rating_accuracy":10,"review_rating_checkin":10,"review_rating_cleanliness":9,"review_rating_communication":10,"review_rating_location":10,"review_rating_value":10,"is_business_travel_ready":false}}
