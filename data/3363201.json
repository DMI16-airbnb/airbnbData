fully equipped apartment with balcony, two steps away from the metro / train station, with a stunning view on the sky-line of Amsterdam. Good parking availability. In calme neighbourhood in vivid East part and close to city centre.\n\nMy spacious (85m2), top floor apartment is a hide-away from my hectic international travels. But at the same time, being in the beautiful city of Amsterdam, I want it to be close to where the action happens. \nThis apartment offers you both: peaceful surroundings and the proximity of the Amsterdam culture and nightlife . It has everything you'll need for a great stay in a dynamic city. Because it is the top floor, the whole apartment is filled with light. This puts a spotlight on its tasteful interior and spacious character. It is fully equipped with quality utilities to make your stay even more comfortable. \n\nSince it is a one-bedroom apartment, you will enjoy the comfort the most when staying alone or with two people. The two extra air-beds offer you the possibility to stay in the apartment with maximum 4 people.\n\n\nAs a guest you will have access to the following:\n\n- Free WiFi\n- Digital TV with international channels\n- Kitchen with all appliances present (dish washer included)\n- Bedroom with double bed and TV (plugin for laptop)\n- Two Air beds \n- Bathroom with bathtub, walk-in shower, hair dryer \n- Linnen, towels, shampoo\n- Washing machine and Dryer\n- Balcony with parasol\n\nJolanda a good friend of ours will manage the apartment when we are away for work. She is a great woman and knows the city like no other. When you need help, tips or recommendations, please don't hesitate to ask her!\n\nJust two steps from your front door you’ll have a spectrum of possibilities. Right across from the apartment is The Amstel Station, which offers you:\n- an 8 minute metro ride to the heart of the city centre\n- a train trip to a rich choice of cultural / fun / romantic destinations in the Netherlands\n- a convenient variety of shops open till midnight\n- a bike rental shop\n- a spectacle performed by Dutch people showing their daily routines\n\nThe neighborhood is located at the Amstel River and you can find some great restaurants within a 5 minute walk. The famous Restaurant Dauphine is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Make sure you reserve a table before you go. Across from Dauphine you will find the Dutch version of Starbuck’s: The Coffee Company. A hip place to have a laid back coffee. My favorite spot is Riva, this amazingly designed restaurant is located on the shore of the Amstel River and has one of the best outdoor terraces of Amsterdam. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and you want to be early on a sunny day. You just want to spend your whole day on this terrace watching boats passing by while drinking great wines.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmstel station is one of the hubs in Amsterdam.

The apartment was beautiful and we were extremely comfortable there. The train and tram stopped right opposite the apartment and it was very easy to get to the main locations (Central, Museumplein). If we stay in Amsterdam again we can't imagine getting another place! Loved every bit of it!
