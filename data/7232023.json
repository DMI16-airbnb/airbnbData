Very central near metro, train, tram, supermarket, riverside restaurants & bars. Walk to the center along the river\n\nA houseboat all to yourself in a great central location! Comes with fully equipped kitchen with dish washer, fridge, big professional stove and oven, washing machine, compact bathroom with shower and toilet, 2 bedrooms with comfortable box spring double bed and a single box spring bed in the other. There's central heating and WIFI too!\n\nThere is an optional small second bedroom you can book. Please note it's small.. but with a very comfortable single boxspring bed.

Please book 3 persons or let us know when you book and we will update the price with €20 per night because it involves a bit more cleaning and laundry. Hope you understand. Thanks!\n\nWe welcome you personally upon arrival and will get you settled in and answer all questions you may have. Where to go and what to see etc. And you can always contact us of course so we make your stay and visit to Amsterdam into a success! That's a promise! We also have a folder available with tips and recommendations both locally and in the center\n\nThe houseboat is in a quiet spot for quiet nights yet you are walking distance from the center. There are many bars and good restaurants nearby. Further along the street you find riverside cafes and restaurants. We recommend a few places like restaurant Dauphine, an old Renault car garage converted into restaurant, restaurant \"Rijssel\" for classic french cuisine with a hip twist, \"The Ysbreeker\" for coffee and drinks and 7th floor rooftop restaurant \"Canvas\" at the \"Volkshotel\" with a great view over the city. All within a few minutes walk. Contact us for reservations, no problem. We also have a folder available with recommendations on where to go\n\nMetro station (Wibautstraat) is a 2 minute walk\nTrain station (Amsterdam Amstel) is a 5 minute walk\nTram stop for #3 is a 5 minute walk and takes you to the museum area in 15 minutes \nWe recommend you walk along the river to the center. It's a lovely stroll and you will pass the famous Amstel Hotel, Carré theatre, the world famous skinny bridge, Hermitage museum, old Amstel locks and so on. As a little service, we also have two bikes available you can hop on. We rent them out for s small price. It's the best way to go around town. We all do!\n\nThe Amstel is the famous river of Amsterdam with many houseboats lined up on it's bank. Sometimes one, sometimes two, three or four alongside eachother. There are two houseboats next to eachother where we are. We are the first in line meaning there's no real view from inside over the river. The view is to the left (bedroom) and right (livingroom) from the houseboat in front. It's still a great view from the bedroom and livingroom though and there a pleasant green view and 10m2 of terrace at the entrance","description_locale":"en","experiences_offered":"none","extra_user_info":null,"extras_price_native":20,"guests_included":2,"has_agreed_to_legal_terms":true,"has_license":false,"has_viewed_cleaning":null,"has_viewed_ib_perf_dashboard_panel":null,"has_viewed_terms":true,"house_rules":"No smoking and no drugs please and we trust you respect the place and area like we would yours","instant_book_welcome_message":"","interaction":"We welcome you personally upon arrival and will get you settled in and answer all questions you may have.
