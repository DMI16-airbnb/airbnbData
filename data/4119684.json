deluxe and modern renovated 1st floor apartment with fascinating River view, 1 Master Bedroom, Rain Shower, app.: 861 ft.² \n\n2 French balconies in front (Amstel River View) and 1 in the back.\n\nIt's like a Presidential Suite with a spectacular view!\n\nThe apartment \nThe 80m2 (861 ft2) apartment is located on the first floor of a riverside apartment building, build in 1912. The building has 7 apartments in total, divided over 4 floors.\n\nThe space was completely renovated in April 2014, bringing modern luxury and light into the 102-year-old property, while retaining original features, such as ceiling beams.\n\nThe apartment has a big living room in the front with direct \"Amstel\" river views, a fully equipped luxurious kitchen, one master bedroom (a double bed, with two separate mattresses and blankets) in the back, that leads to a connecting bathroom with big rain shower and utility closet; including a washing machine and dryer, as well as a separate toilet. \n\nFeatures:\n•Unesco World Heritage Site \n•Big living room: direct \"Amstel\" river views\n•Fully equipped luxurious kitchen\n•Self-catering \n•1 Master bedroom: a double bed with two separate mattresses and blankets\n•Sleeps 2 adult’s \n•Bed linen and towels are provided \n•Connecting bathroom with big rain shower\n•Utility closet including a washing machine and dryer\n•Separate toilet \n•Free fast WiFi Internet \n•Cable TV, 46-inch built-in Smart TV\n\nYou can always get in touch with me. Before your stay I will send you a detailed e-mail with everything you will need to know. Someone will welcome you on the day of your arrival and will give you a tour of the apartment.\n\nThe location\nThe apartment is situated in one of the best locations of Amsterdam City center and has breath-taking wide views of Amsterdam's most famous and prestigious “canal” – the Amstel River - that gives Amsterdam its name. \n\nThe apartment is located on the first floor of the building, allowing spectacular views from the living room. This location places the property right in the heart of Amsterdam’s Unesco World Heritage site, yet meters away from “the Pijp”, a neighborhood famous for it’s bars, cafes and restaurants, as well as the city’s biggest market.\n\nThe apartment is situated right in between the glamorous Royal Theater – “Carré”  – and the exclusive “Amstel hotel”. A little further along is the romantic “Magere Brug” (Skinny Bridge), the “Hermitage Museum” and the Opera house (“Het Muziektheater”).\n\nYou can wake up in the morning and take in the views with a cup of coffee on one of the balconies, before popping into a neighborhood bakery for breakfast croissants. In the evening, stroll along to one of the many nearby restaurants, before enjoying a drink at a typical Amsterdam “bruin café”.\n\nWalk just 300 meters, and you can find yourself on the “Utrechtsestraat”, renowned for its many restaurants, cafes, designer boutiques, lovely bakeries and wine shops. The local feel of the Utrechtsestraat makes it an excellent option for tourists who want to become “Amsterdammers” (even if only for a couple of days). Plus, it’s a prime spot for hunting out the best and most original gifts to take back home. For the partygoers, popular Rembrandt Square is only 700 meters away.\n\nFor exploring further a field, there is a tram stop just 50 meters away, with a direct line to the Museum Quarter (Rijksmuseum, Stedelijk Museum and Van Gogh Museum). And just 250 meters away, there is a metro/underground station “Weesperplein”, which is only 2 short stops away from the Central Train Station or Amstel Train Station.From there direct trains to: Schiphol AMS Airport, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Antwerp, Paris. \n\n\nThe tram stops just 50 meters away, with a direct line to the Museum Quarter (Rijksmuseum, Stedelijk Museum and Van Gogh Museum). \n\nJust 250 meters away, there is a metro/underground station “Weesperplein”, which is only 2 short stops away from the Centraal Train Station or Amstel Train Station.\nFrom there direct trains to: Schiphol AMS Airport, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Antwerp, Paris. \n\n\nRent a bicycle!
