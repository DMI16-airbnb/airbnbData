Both during day and night the view is breathtaking\n\nYou have access to your room, the steering hut or outside area for relaxing and enjoying the view over the river, kitchen / dining area for preparing your own breakfast, the shared bathroom and toilet.\n\nI will give you detailed information about the use and history of the ship and some useful information about the city if required.\n\nMS \"Morgenster\" is build in 1907 as a freight ship and recently renovated into a very luxurious apartment.

Neither of us were in doubt that the best thing was staying in Martijn's houseboat, in the comfort of his great hospitality and cool friends. \r\n\r\nThe boat is situated at a perfect spot on the Amstel river, along one of the main canals with a great view of the National Opera and old, idyllic merchant houses on all sides. Walking to either the central train station or the Museum Square takes only apprixomately 15 minutes each, but there is also a metro station very close by.\r\n\r\nMartijn proved extremely helpful, providing a wealth of suggestions and advice on what to do in Amsterdam and even including us in his rich social life.  His cat Roef is furthermore an attraction in himself.\r\n\r\nVery highly recommended!
