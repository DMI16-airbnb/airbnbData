With a spacious living room, a large dining room, 4 bedrooms and a garden, it's perfect for design-loving families.\n\nOur apartment was recently renovated (2013) by a well known architect. The living space and dining room are spacious enough for everyone to enjoy themselves. The dining room has an open kitchen, with a large Italian stove (double oven, hot plate), a breakfast bar with designer stools, a large dining table that seats 8 people comfortably. From the dining room two doors open to our beautiful, spacious garden with custom built outdoor kitchen, sofa's, table and chairs to enjoy dinner outside. For the children we have a trampoline, swing and hammock. [Pictures will follow soon!]\n\nThe living room connects to the dining room. It features two large couches, a built in fire place (electric), large Loewe tv-system, and a semi-seperate play room with toys for the children.\n\nLiving room and dining room both have separate toilet spaces.\n\nThe bedrooms are situated in the souterrain. We have 1 large children's room with two beds, tv and dvd, and Wii-computer. The other children's room is larger, and features 1 bed (easily fits an extra bed upon request). This room has a door that opens to the garden.\n\nThe children's bath room has a bath, rain shower and toilet.\n\nThe master bed room features a queen size bed, tv and dvd, built in closet, and an en suite bathroom with rain shower, toilet and double sink.\n\nThere's a fourth bedroom that serves as a home office. This room has a twin guest bed and separate entree to the street.\n\nOur guests can enjoy free and fast wifi. The house has a Sonos music system that connects to online and wireless radio etc.\n\nAmsterdam is best and easily enjoyed by bike. Two adult and one children's (10-12 years) bikes are available and free for you to use.\n\nOur apartment is on a typical Amsterdam Canal that's quiet yet central. We are around the corner of Carré Theater. Artis Zoo is a 5 minute walk. The hip shopping street Utrechtsestraat is a 10 minute walk, that you'll reach by crossing the famous skinny bridge. Waterlooplein is also a 10 minute walk away.\n\nWe love our neighborhood because of the proximity of restaurants, bars and musea, without having to deal with the noise and chaos. Only steps away you'll find numerous good breakfast bars that serve great coffee.\n\nTram lines 6, 7 and 10 are nearby and all subway lines stop at Weesperplein, which is a few minutes away by foot. If you would arrive in Amsterdam by train, our apartment is just three stops by subway from Central Station.","description_locale":"en","experiences_offered":"none","extra_user_info":null,"extras_price_native":100,"guests_included":5,"has_agreed_to_legal_terms":true,"has_license":false,"has_viewed_cleaning":null,"has_viewed_ib_perf_dashboard_panel":null,"has_viewed_terms":true,"house_rules":"This is our family home.

The very spacious and tastefully furnished canal house close to the Amsterdam's city center is well equipped to make you feel at home the moment you step in. A true gem. Professional kitchen, premium audio and entertainment equipment, very comfy couch landscape and....oh my god...those leather chairs! \nThe beautiful garden rounds off the package.\n\nIt's possible to walk to the city center but the Metro is also around the corner. Groceries shopping can be done close by. \n\nIf you're exploring the city by boat on your own - which is a must (try (URL HIDDEN) -  it's possible to moor and board a boat 100m meters down the street.\n\nKarin was very kind, responsive and helpful as well as accomodating towards all our special requests. \nWe'd come back anytime.
