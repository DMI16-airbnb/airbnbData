The bakery, only a 2 minute walk from the front door had a great cup of coffee to get me going in the morning. marvelous restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk and amazing breakfast spots even closer. Thanks for letting us use your well proportioned apartment Bas, being so quick to respond to any questions. Oh yes, your taste in books complements my own, so I really did feel quite at home.\r\nI would recommend :)","created_at":"2016-06-04T01:59:40Z","id":77793995,"listing_id":2011601,"reviewee_id":10226170,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Tamlynn","has_profile_pic":true,"id":27583875,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/27583875/profile_pic/1423736416/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/27583875/profile_pic/1423736416/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":27583875,"role":"guest"}},"toto_opt_in":null,"wireless_info":null,"listing_occupancy_info":{"show_occupancy_message":true},"review_rating_accuracy":9,"review_rating_checkin":10,"review_rating_cleanliness":9,"review_rating_communication":10,"review_rating_location":9,"review_rating_value":9,"is_business_travel_ready":true}}
