There was a warm welcome and explenation of all details incl. details for Amsterdam recommendation for Restaurant nearby... We had a good start and feel good in this apartment. It is really spaciuos, clean and equipped with alls things we needed during our stay. In a walking distance we found little shops and good Restaurants. Best thing to explore Amsterdam was the Metro station. You can travel within a few Minutes to the City center. \r\nWe had a good Weekend in a lovely apartment and a fantastic stay in Amsterdam.","created_at":"2016-06-28T02:54:08Z","id":82491450,"listing_id":12910752,"reviewee_id":16229447,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Jens","has_profile_pic":true,"id":54576198,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/58593bd2-7f8f-44ba-8d32-01e90dd3d559.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/58593bd2-7f8f-44ba-8d32-01e90dd3d559.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":54576198,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":12910752,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.35362473766419,"lng":4.913146140241182,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b0a50e9e-0ad6-4870-8199-2bd93c4b90a7.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Spacious familyplace nearby centre!","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b0a50e9e-0ad6-4870-8199-2bd93c4b90a7.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":156,"price_formatted":"$161","price_native":161,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b0a50e9e-0ad6-4870-8199-2bd93c4b90a7.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Katrín","has_profile_pic":true,"id":16229447,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/1ab08e89-987b-4794-8c0c-0c2ddd830d72.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/1ab08e89-987b-4794-8c0c-0c2ddd830d72.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":16229447,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b0a50e9e-0ad6-4870-8199-2bd93c4b90a7.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Katrín","has_profile_pic":true,"id":16229447,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/1ab08e89-987b-4794-8c0c-0c2ddd830d72.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/1ab08e89-987b-4794-8c0c-0c2ddd830d72.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":2,"work":""}
