An apartment owned by Ellen whose heart beats for Amsterdam. An apartment that allows you to start or continue loving Amsterdam.....\r\n\r\nYou know, over 20 years ago Ellen and I met; while traveling! There was no Airbnb, more or less no internet. But there was this woman....Ellen; who started our friendship the same enthusiastic and open way as she presents herself on Airbnb...... \"Hi, my name is Ellen!....\r\n\r\nEllen likes to discover, just like you. When you  travel to Amsterdam, looking for a place to stay.......it is because you want to discover this great city!\r\n\r\nA city that combines. A city that opens up, a city that tells you: \"don't leave me without living me to your maximum\".\r\n\r\nEllen is the same. She is spontaneous. She is enthusiastic, makes you feel welcome and she takes care of you. You will find that back in this apartment. \r\n\r\nThis apartment gives you a perfect opportunity to live the city of Amsterdam. A wonderful and modern spot in the heart of an historic and powerful city. And do you know why? Because Ellen brought the city inside her place....and added this apartment to the purity of Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nFor sure i would recommend this apartment. Ellen is reliable. She knows what you are looking for in Amsterdam, an will help you find it.\r\n\r\nSo, just book it. You will have a fabulous Amsterdam experience.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n","relationship_type":"friend","relationship_type_text":"Friend","user_id":9807043}},"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"L'appartement est très bien situé, au coeur d'Amsterdam. Vous pouvez tout faire à pieds (ou à vélo). :)\r\nL'appartement est à 1 rue du célèbre Red Light District. Cela peut donc être un peu bruyant la nuit mais pour notre part nous avons dormi comme des bébés. L'appartement d'Ellen est assez grand et sur 2 étages. Il est décoré avec goût.","created_at":"2016-06-27T03:16:34Z","id":82206412,"listing_id":5028788,"reviewee_id":9807043,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Noëmie","has_profile_pic":true,"id":10622559,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/10622559/profile_pic/1387063200/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/10622559/profile_pic/1387063200/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":10622559,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":5028788,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.37387073743655,"lng":4.899157190217399,"medium_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/100848924/00e04f0e_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"1 room apartment in heart of city","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/100848924/00e04f0e_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":150,"price_formatted":"$155","price_native":155,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/100848924/00e04f0e_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Ellen","has_profile_pic":true,"id":9807043,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/9807043/profile_pic/1439841078/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/9807043/profile_pic/1439841078/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":9807043,"xl_picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/100848924/00e04f0e_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Ellen","has_profile_pic":true,"id":9807043,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/9807043/profile_pic/1439841078/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/9807043/profile_pic/1439841078/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":1,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"KLM Royal Dutch Airlines."}
