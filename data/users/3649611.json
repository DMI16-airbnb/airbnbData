Such a beautiful apartment and such a nice guy! He even left us sparkling wine as a welcome gift! The location is perfect, in a nice part of town just on the edge of the centre, right near the Amstel and a metro station. We loved sitting on the rooftop patio watching the sun set and taking jacuzzi baths when our legs were sore from days of adventures. Good wifi, fully equipped kitchen including washing machine, and cool decor. Bart was lovely when he met us to give us the keys.","created_at":"2016-06-26T00:38:51Z","id":81872717,"listing_id":5741543,"reviewee_id":3649611,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Emma","has_profile_pic":true,"id":5359948,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/1444f025-c41e-4af2-9266-8d0e1096c29c.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/1444f025-c41e-4af2-9266-8d0e1096c29c.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":5359948,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":5741543,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.358359419893134,"lng":4.9124744478647555,"medium_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/71458766/aa855222_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"luxurious apartment of 45m2","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/71458766/aa855222_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":110,"price_formatted":"$113","price_native":113,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/71458766/aa855222_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Bart","has_profile_pic":true,"id":3649611,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/3649611/profile_pic/1427027615/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/3649611/profile_pic/1427027615/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":3649611,"xl_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/71458766/aa855222_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Bart","has_profile_pic":true,"id":3649611,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/3649611/profile_pic/1427027615/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/3649611/profile_pic/1427027615/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Copernicus SG Hoorn, Hogeschool voor de Kunsten Utrecht, VU University Amsterdam, Open Studio","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
