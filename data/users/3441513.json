It was only 3 metro stops to the red light district and convenient to the airport. In addition the the metro line to the general area was fab when we walked toward the pique area (highly recommend walking to bakers and roasters for brunch - on your walk take the market). Really enjoyed our time here would definitely stay again! When we went first went up the apartment stairs my husband looked at me (looked a bit shabby) but he absolutely loved it too!! Also when we got off wibaustraat wasn't too impressed with the street but the apartment is in a gorgeous little area and right beside the river and nice walk to Heineken experience and markets and areas as well as being close to city. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend!!! Oh and a lovely touch was a little gift from Ellen and lots of information. She wasn't in the country but her replacement host spent time with us explained everything and they were so flexible with check in. Highly recommend!!!","created_at":"2016-06-06T02:25:59Z","id":78167340,"listing_id":7007415,"reviewee_id":3441513,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Laura","has_profile_pic":true,"id":20392257,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/20392257/profile_pic/1408777925/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/20392257/profile_pic/1408777925/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":20392257,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":7007415,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.35176683678448,"lng":4.911528938709069,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/bc95968d-9545-4277-9eb8-3ad98aa4da5c.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Cosy light apartment @ Amstel River","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/bc95968d-9545-4277-9eb8-3ad98aa4da5c.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":144,"price_formatted":"$148","price_native":148,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/bc95968d-9545-4277-9eb8-3ad98aa4da5c.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Ellen","has_profile_pic":true,"id":3441513,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/98fc2d78-3305-4a90-a048-a8ba88069f83.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/98fc2d78-3305-4a90-a048-a8ba88069f83.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":3441513,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/bc95968d-9545-4277-9eb8-3ad98aa4da5c.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Ellen","has_profile_pic":true,"id":3441513,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/98fc2d78-3305-4a90-a048-a8ba88069f83.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/98fc2d78-3305-4a90-a048-a8ba88069f83.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
