Staying in other people's homes comes close to a bit of that experience ;-)   That experience is exactly what we want to share with the ones who stay in our home.\r\n\r\nWe live close to Amstel River, which I really enjoy. I love strolling alongside the river, taking a boat trip on it or just sit next to it on my own or with family, friends or a book. \r\n\r\nNext to that , enjoying life consists of wining and dining with friends, cooking, windsurfing, reading, working and lots of little things, and....... city trips and holidays are definitely high on the favorite list!\r\n\r\nArie and myself are both self employed (as photographers and corporate lawyer). In September 2014 Jeppe joined and showed to be a perfect fit ;-)\r\nIn future we hope to discover lots more together.
