We are now living in Amsterdam and working as independent check-in managers for owners and landlords.\r\n\r\n“Si si claro” means “yes of course!” in Spanish, and was the name of our Bed & Breakfast in Barcelona. This B&B – since 2010 – was located in our own home. That’s when we learned how valuable it is to have a trustworthy person taking care of your home and guests when travelling. Since 2013 we take care of the home and guests of others in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nWe strongly believe the mix of outstanding hospitality, personal attention and accurate guest selection is the key to successful short term rental of your home.\r\n\r\nA little description about myself (Luis).... I am Argentinian, an outgoing person, when I have some free time i like to take my car and go out to the mountains to enjoy the nature and relax.\r\n\r\nI love my family, my son Max and friends, and of course a good BBQ :-) \r\n\r\nWe wish you a great time in this beautiful city Amsterdam and we will  make you feel like home even if you are far from your first home ;-)\r\n\r\n","friends_count":1,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["English","Español","Português"],"listings_count":23,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":{"recommendation":{"created_at":"2014-04-03T07:49:04Z","id":296080,"left_by_user":{"user":{"first_name":"Mark","has_profile_pic":true,"id":7017633,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7017633/profile_pic/1396376321/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7017633/profile_pic/1396376321/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","acceptance_rate":"100%","created_at":"2013-06-20T14:10:39Z","identity_verified":true,"is_superhost":true,"picture_large_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7017633/profile_pic/1396376321/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_large","recommendation_count":4,"response_rate":"100%","response_time":"within an hour","reviewee_count":73,"thumbnail_medium_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7017633/profile_pic/1396376321/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_medium"}},"recommendation":"Joost is one of the most vibrant people I've met in my life.

The house was tidy and comfortable. Kitchen is fully equipped for cooking. We walked to and from the center but also took the tram. Both very doable. Lots of shopping, restaurants, grocery store, and bike rentals close by. Luis was very friendly and accessible.
