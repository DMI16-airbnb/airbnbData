We live with our red cat Uluru at the beautiful Weesperzijde in the East of Amsterdam; just a few minutes away from the museum district and the city center and with a splendid view on the river Amstel. We both are journalists. Tim works as a freelance video maker and Marc works at the communication department of the biggest hospital in Amsterdam. \r\nWe love travelling and adventures. From 2005 till 2010, we lived and worked in Sydney, Australia, as freelance correspondents for the Dutch and Belgian media. We love Tintin (Kuifje), we love sports and of course we love cycling. We offer our guests private cycling tours through Amsterdam and surrounding ( a fee applies). Very Dutch!\r\nSo, welcome to Amsterdam and the Weesperzijde!\r\n","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["Deutsch","English","Fran√ßais","Italiano"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Tim was a fabulous host, very welcoming and super flexible.
