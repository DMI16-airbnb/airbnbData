As the pictures show, it has been decorated in an eclectic style. There are large windows on either side of the apartment - one overlooking the street and the other, a quiet residential courtyard. It helps that there is an elevator when you have luggage.\nThe kitchen is well equipped, wifi works fine, beds very comfortable- we were also welcomed in with some wine and cookies. The museum cards which were kindly left for us to use were very helpful!\nThe lighting has dimmer switches on remote control - helps you make a relaxed ambience :)\nNegatives - I can't think of any at all !!\nHighly recommended!!","created_at":"2016-06-15T02:57:20Z","id":79891706,"listing_id":3155756,"reviewee_id":2888590,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Pankaj","has_profile_pic":true,"id":7189551,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/7189551/profile_pic/1376835381/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/7189551/profile_pic/1376835381/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":7189551,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":3155756,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.3542963550329,"lng":4.912460100148915,"medium_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/40300853/52bb2f70_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Big app in Amsterdam","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/40300853/52bb2f70_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":217,"price_formatted":"$224","price_native":224,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/40300853/52bb2f70_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Sander","has_profile_pic":true,"id":2888590,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2888590/profile_pic/1434367045/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2888590/profile_pic/1434367045/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":2888590,"xl_picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/40300853/52bb2f70_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Sander","has_profile_pic":true,"id":2888590,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2888590/profile_pic/1434367045/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2888590/profile_pic/1434367045/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Art Academy ","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"Creative Industrie"}
