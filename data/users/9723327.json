Together we run an interior design company where Jasper, as a designer, is the creative mind and founder of the company. Eva is responsible for a lot of communication and organization behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nWhen we are in Amsterdam we love to go to museums and theaters, festivals and nice restaurants or tour over the canals since we both can sail. We made a little manual for our guests that includes some nice spots in the neighbourhood, but always feel free to ask for some more up-to-date tips!\r\n\r\nBesides Amsterdam, we love to travel to sunny places or go for a ski in the winter. Last December we traveled for the first time with AirBnb when we celebrated our anniversary in New York. We loved the experience and enjoy meeting people that love to travel as much as we do. Hopefully our houseboat can be the perfect home for you to experience Amsterdam in a unique way!\r\n\r\nThe newly build houseboat was kind of Jaspers prestige project. It took him, and a team of professional boat builders, 2 years to complete it from its steel scratch casco. Now that it's finished we are more than happy with the result and love to share it with the AirBnb community!\r\n\r\nWe hope to see you soon, you're welcome! \r\n","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["Deutsch","English","Nederlands"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Jasper's houseboat was a magical special experience. The boat sits in a quiet spot on a lovely canal looking out onto trees. The boat is a  showpiece of contemporary design....the epitome of good taste from the beautiful walnut floors to the modern and very functional furniture. I want one of those couches!! Pushbutton heaven for everything. \nThe neighborhood is great...walking distance to many sites and just a couple of tramstops (if you can't be bothered walking) to the Rijks and Van Gogh museums. The Zoo and the Hermitage museum are around the corner. Great supermarket and plenty of good food options nearby. \nDidn't want to leave!\n","created_at":"2016-06-28T07:33:25Z","id":82561431,"listing_id":1864726,"reviewee_id":9723327,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Sara","has_profile_pic":true,"id":43932102,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/4eda9da3-7e45-4649-9c19-8a3d76a28148.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/4eda9da3-7e45-4649-9c19-8a3d76a28148.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":43932102,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":1864726,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.36502873702563,"lng":4.9081834287585435,"medium_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/52786598/769b1cd9_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"New design houseboat, green centre","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/52786598/769b1cd9_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":295,"price_formatted":"$304","price_native":304,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/52786598/769b1cd9_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Jasper","has_profile_pic":true,"id":9723327,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/9723327/profile_pic/1430212452/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/9723327/profile_pic/1430212452/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":9723327,"xl_picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/52786598/769b1cd9_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Jasper","has_profile_pic":true,"id":9723327,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/9723327/profile_pic/1430212452/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/9723327/profile_pic/1430212452/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Design Academy","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":2,"work":"(URL HIDDEN)"}
