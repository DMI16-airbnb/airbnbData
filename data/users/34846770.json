We live here with our little baby girl Lilly, born in May 2015.\r\nOur motto for life is work hard, play hard: Mirte is a marketing manager in FMCG and Bas is account manager in the rail and infrastructure industry. Enough about work; we both love to travel, far away or closeby, our last vacation was to Cuba in December '14. Bas loves paragliding and visits the beach and dunes at least once a week to fly; even more he loves paragliding in the Alps, so if he's not enjoying Amsterdam; chances are you'll find him in Austria. I myself love cooking, running (great combination ;-)), shopping and reading. And I hate how boring my life looks compared to Bas' ;-). \r\nOh and we do have other things in common, we both love watching movies and series! \r\n\r\nWe bought our house in March '15. With an extensive renovation (in both time and euro's) we turned it into our perfect little Amsterdam-palace  and we treat it with care. We will take good care of your house, and expect you to do the same with ours.
