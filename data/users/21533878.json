I was born in Amsterdam, studied notarial law in Leiden and lived a couple of years in Luxemburg and Spain. I really love Amsterdam and its (social) history, I can tell you everything about it! In my free time I like to read non fiction, to write, to cook, to ride a motorbike, to meet up with friends, to play tennis, to go for a run etc. ","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":[],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Angelo is a great host.
