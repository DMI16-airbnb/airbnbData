Close by the vibrant Pijp with nice bars en restaurants. (She even works in the nicest one of them all Het Paardje). Also close by the city centre where you can find the Leidse square and the Rembrandt square. If you want to parade along some of the best markets Amsterdam has to offer this place is also within walking distance.\r\nShortly, this nice appartement, provided with every sense of luxury you'll need, is located close to all the must see places for your perfect Amsterdam city trip!

Away of tourist crowds yet close to center and museums.\n- direct view on Amstel river.\n- flat is in an old building thus has a great volume and bright character. Light, airy, nicely decorated one. \n- nice bed.\n- there are Nespresso capsules and water/food for guests, it's a very pleasant touch from the host. \n- Carmen is a nice host, flexible and responsive. \n\nCons:\n- old building means tough stairs and yourself being a bit more intimate to the neighbors that you may wish.\n- bathroom has neither sink nor mirror. You should use kitchen sink and rooms' mirrors instead. Bathroom is tiny, I would say 2 square meters for both shower and toilet. \n- kitchen is basic one, no microwave.\n- lightening is limited so can be dark at evenings.\n- if you care about TV (personally I didn't), there is no TV. \n\nFew tips:\n- from Schiphol: at Central Station, take metro M54 till Wibaustraat then cross river over bridge and walk a bit; or take tram 4. \n- there are plenty of supermarkets at Van Woustraat.\n- close to apartment, there is a restaurant called fa.pekelhaaring, one of the best we've ever been in Amsterdam. If you cross the river, go to De Ysbreeker for relaxed brunch. \n\nOverall, if bathroom means a little for you and you like the charm of old buildings, you will definitely enjoy the flat and A'dam itself.
