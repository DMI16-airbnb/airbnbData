We've been together for over 15 years, and proud parents of Bente (2,5) and Mats (6 months). Maike works for the national news broadcaster, Bas is a self-employed handyman and artist. We love traveling and have spent a whole year on the road in 2007. We bought this house in 2010 and spent a year and a half doing it up. We have a cat and lovely neighbors, and the neighborhood has everything you need (shops, cafes, restaurants, the river Amstel). You're more then welcome to stay in our house!

Only minutes away from centre and a minutes walk to the Metro station. Our hosts left us some lovely traditional treats to try and the accommodation was exactly what we needed. Bright, clean, spacious and homely too. Lots of info given about the local area and places of interest.  Having the fat cat to come back to was an added bonus as we got lots of cuddles. Great value for money. Would definitely go back.
