I have a great cosy and atmospheric appartement with fantastic space and light. It is located next to Subway station 'Weesperplein' and a 2 minute walk to the famous Amstel Hotel. The Utrechtsestraat, 'Carre' are also around the corner. \r\n\r\n","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["English","Nederlands"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"We had the best stay at Vera's place. From pre booking, Vera was easy to communicate with and she replied to all of our questions. She even gave us suggestions on restaurants and all about Amsterdam. When we checked in, Vera's sister - Sonja was really nice to wait for us late at night to check in at their place. We only met Sonja because Vera was on vacation but Vera made sure that she was easy to reach out to. Thanks Vera for accommodating our friend's request for the welcome gift. \r\nThe listing was great! Very accessible and convenient. There's a tram and train station right across the street and you're minutes away to tourist places. It's also safe and quiet in the area. The listing is clean, well maintained and has everything you need. And high speed Wifi!! We had a wonderful time in Amsterdam because of Vera, her place and their hospitality. It was our home away from home. Thanks a lot Vera! Superhost and superb listing!!","created_at":"2016-04-15T03:08:07Z","id":69919987,"listing_id":5940213,"reviewee_id":11468114,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Joy","has_profile_pic":true,"id":474164,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/34374601-a1b4-4dbe-b219-d3eb2bd3671e.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/34374601-a1b4-4dbe-b219-d3eb2bd3671e.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":474164,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":5940213,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.36117454388113,"lng":4.906143223490686,"medium_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/73964088/a1d86468_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Beautiful appartment great location","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/73964088/a1d86468_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":128,"price_formatted":"$132","price_native":132,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/73964088/a1d86468_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Vera","has_profile_pic":true,"id":11468114,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/11468114/profile_pic/1390215881/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/11468114/profile_pic/1390215881/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":11468114,"xl_picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/73964088/a1d86468_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Vera","has_profile_pic":true,"id":11468114,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/11468114/profile_pic/1390215881/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/11468114/profile_pic/1390215881/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Hogeschool NVM SOM Makelaardij (MER)","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"Consultant"}
