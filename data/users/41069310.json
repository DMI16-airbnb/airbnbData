We love to travel to new destinations within Europe and love to come back home to relax. That's why we bought this new apartment in April as it new, centrally located and yet very quiet living on the canal.  Our style of hosting is to make you feel at home in Amsterdam and assist you with anything you may need to get around!","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":[],"listings_count":2,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"The apartment is really nice and modern: well situated, great views on canals, and really quiet at night to make nice and good sleeps! Only 30meters from the apartment, there is a shop to rent bikes and then, all Amsterdam is at you! \r\nThe pass they gave us for the museum is such an advantage. When you combine all the museums, it makes such an economy!\r\nThank you so much for everything. We will definitly come back in this apartment next time.","created_at":"2016-06-06T02:58:04Z","id":78192352,"listing_id":7802556,"reviewee_id":41069310,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Fx","has_profile_pic":true,"id":6489039,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/6489039/profile_pic/1369093003/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/6489039/profile_pic/1369093003/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":6489039,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":7802556,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.368974570616174,"lng":4.90566968073595,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/99290282/faa876ca_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"New apartment in heart of Amsterdam","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/99290282/faa876ca_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":139,"price_formatted":"$143","price_native":143,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/99290282/faa876ca_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Ethan","has_profile_pic":true,"id":41069310,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/41069310/profile_pic/1439803784/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/41069310/profile_pic/1439803784/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":41069310,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/99290282/faa876ca_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Ethan","has_profile_pic":true,"id":41069310,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/41069310/profile_pic/1439803784/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/41069310/profile_pic/1439803784/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":2,"total_listings_count":2,"work":""}
