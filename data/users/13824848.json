The apartment is a great space for relaxing after a long day out. Everything you would expect from your own home; clean, quiet, safe, comfortable beds, good linens & towels, high-speed WiFi, cable TV and a washer & dryer which was a major plus for us as this was our half-way point in our trip. The bathroom/shower is enormous, you could hold a party there ! Highly recommend. Only negative is there are two flights of narrow, steep stairs, but then again, most places in Amsterdam are the same.   FYI - watch your bags when walking around the Red Light district at night - lots of pick/pockets !","created_at":"2016-05-24T01:11:34Z","id":75889702,"listing_id":9611073,"reviewee_id":13824848,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Kim","has_profile_pic":true,"id":54015825,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/dbc7c50b-78d9-4b18-bdf5-55d56c028737.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/dbc7c50b-78d9-4b18-bdf5-55d56c028737.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":54015825,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":9611073,"instant_bookable":true,"lat":52.37223193704198,"lng":4.899426187943015,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/5a34b765-1066-4917-a1e1-925c4827daa0.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Comfy Design Inner City Canal View Apartment (3pp)","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/5a34b765-1066-4917-a1e1-925c4827daa0.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":244,"price_formatted":"$251","price_native":251,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/5a34b765-1066-4917-a1e1-925c4827daa0.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Bas","has_profile_pic":true,"id":13824848,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b10d9730-a846-499e-9187-af80e213627b.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b10d9730-a846-499e-9187-af80e213627b.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":13824848,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/5a34b765-1066-4917-a1e1-925c4827daa0.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Bas","has_profile_pic":true,"id":13824848,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b10d9730-a846-499e-9187-af80e213627b.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b10d9730-a846-499e-9187-af80e213627b.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"University of Technology Sydney, University of Amsterdam","signup_method":1,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"Helping Digital Startups"}
