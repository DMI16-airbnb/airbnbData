Annemieke warmly welcomed us into the flat and we had a very spacious place to stay. The living room was super cosy and the kitchen so modernly useful! I really recommend staying at their place as the neighbourhood seemed very friendly (like almost all of Amsterdam) and close to the center. It was my first airbnb so I'm glad to have started with these two! :)","created_at":"2016-05-30T04:20:40Z","id":76955264,"listing_id":13149439,"reviewee_id":61270114,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Pasca","has_profile_pic":true,"id":73329447,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/56e445e9-e7bf-4606-816f-592f1d1a36d6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/56e445e9-e7bf-4606-816f-592f1d1a36d6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":73329447,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":13149439,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.35958548608844,"lng":4.914162064179049,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/7a547be2-47a8-45fc-ac8b-008d4fa9e01f.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Lovely Apartment nearby City Centre","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/7a547be2-47a8-45fc-ac8b-008d4fa9e01f.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":95,"price_formatted":"$98","price_native":98,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/7a547be2-47a8-45fc-ac8b-008d4fa9e01f.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Edwin & Annemieke","has_profile_pic":true,"id":61270114,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8aa328b-70fd-4988-bfda-e436bd175f93.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8aa328b-70fd-4988-bfda-e436bd175f93.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":61270114,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/7a547be2-47a8-45fc-ac8b-008d4fa9e01f.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Edwin & Annemieke","has_profile_pic":true,"id":61270114,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8aa328b-70fd-4988-bfda-e436bd175f93.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8aa328b-70fd-4988-bfda-e436bd175f93.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":2,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
