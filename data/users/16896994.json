Very cosy, comfortable bed, nice living room in a small district of the city. Not the best one but close to city center (10min by subway from Amstel Station -- 15min by tramway from Amsteldijk), with a supermarket at 8min walks.\r\nPelle is a cool guy, very flexible. The place is clean, very cute street, right next to the Amstel river.","created_at":"2016-06-20T01:02:23Z","id":80696268,"listing_id":3348104,"reviewee_id":16896994,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Hugues","has_profile_pic":true,"id":77757734,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/df940183-2d44-4b96-be94-cb69700d75f1.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/df940183-2d44-4b96-be94-cb69700d75f1.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":77757734,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":3348104,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.350206135632945,"lng":4.914566430005453,"medium_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/44744583/80a99652_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Light apartment close to the Amstel","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/44744583/80a99652_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":122,"price_formatted":"$126","price_native":126,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/44744583/80a99652_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Pelle","has_profile_pic":true,"id":16896994,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/16896994/profile_pic/1403007562/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/16896994/profile_pic/1403007562/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":16896994,"xl_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/44744583/80a99652_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Pelle","has_profile_pic":true,"id":16896994,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/16896994/profile_pic/1403007562/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/16896994/profile_pic/1403007562/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
