A smiley, helpful, caring person. He welcomed us with fruits, Stroop Waffles, some breads and printed guides of the city. He even left us a Bonus-Card for discount when buying groceries at the supermarket. He took the time to explain how to activate the appliances at the apartment, and took us to a short walk and showed us what is in the area. He even helped us to choose a party (to celebrate the birthday of one of us) and texted us a day later to check if we enjoy it. Such a great guy.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is very cozy and tastefully designed, equipped with all the essential things we needed, well heated, always with hot water and filled with natural light. The small balcony had a view to a pastoral street, perfect for drinking the morning coffee or relaxing at the evening. We instantly felt at home.\r\n\r\nIt is located next to a main street (easy to navigate), but facing the other side so it is very quiet. The supermarket (which had an ATM in it) is at the next building and the Metro is just next to it. Fantastic! There are some nice Ethnic restaurants, a coffee shop, a bike rental shop and a tram station just 5 minutes from the apartment… and The Amstel River is at the end of the street. You must take a walk next to it under the trees… So romantic.\r\n\r\nWe stayed a full week and we wished we could stay longer. \r\n\r\nGreat host, great apartment, great location - We recommend Emiel's apartment for a great holiday!\r\n\r\n Thank you Emiel from the depth of our hearts.
