The location was perfect, right on the canal, short distance to public transport, restaurants and pubs.\n\nThis was our first experience with Airbnb. Rini made it easy. Always helpful with emails before our arrival.\n\nWe would strongly recommend Rini's apartment.\n\nThanks for making our stay in Amsterdam a fantastic experience.
