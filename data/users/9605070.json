A place that we've enjoyed for many years now and many more to come. Because we have two small boys (Philip and Alexander) and can still travel before they have to go to school we've decided to share our house with you when we're abroad. \r\n\r\nWe fell in love with this house the second we walked into the door. Right in the center of town but with the peace and quiet of the Amstel River in front of us. With the vibrant Pijp to the left and the wonderful Utrechtsestraat to the right you can just walk out of our door to discover the beauty of this awesome city immediately.   \r\n\r\nOur travels involve surfing, yoga, nature, walking, culture, good wine, good reading, family and friends.\r\n\r\nOur live in Amsterdam involves surfing, yoga, nature, walking, culture, good wine, good reading, family and friends.\r\n\r\nAnd of course we work. Anna is a lawyer in the field of intellectual property and I'm the proud owner of a yoga school ((URL HIDDEN) and creative director at an ad agency ((URL HIDDEN) If you’re on a business trip and looking for a great creative meeting place please have a look at some of The Playing Circle locations (t(URL HIDDEN) a company I started years ago. \r\n\r\nWe hope to welcome you soon to our house.\r\n\r\nMaarten & Anna\r\n","friends_count":3,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["Deutsch","English","Español","Français","Nederlands"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":{"recommendation":{"created_at":"2014-07-22T22:03:17Z","id":352897,"left_by_user":{"user":{"first_name":"Chris & Sophie","has_profile_pic":true,"id":2428857,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/2428857/profile_pic/1338387008/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/2428857/profile_pic/1338387008/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","acceptance_rate":"N/A","created_at":"2012-05-21T17:29:25Z","identity_verified":false,"is_superhost":false,"picture_large_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/2428857/profile_pic/1338387008/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_large","recommendation_count":1,"response_rate":"N/A","response_time":"N/A","reviewee_count":0,"thumbnail_medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/2428857/profile_pic/1338387008/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_medium"}},"recommendation":"When you live in such a great home, i understand their desire to share their joy with others. Their place is really awesome: lovely old building and it's interior is a beautiful mix of art, old details and modern design. I guess some words to describe the place are: gorgeous, lovely, luxurious, location! kitchen! View, high end technology ;) and design you actually want to live in! Then about Anna and maarten, they are probably as hospitable as it gets. Their door is always open for family and friends as I am sure it will be for you! A great feeling of responability so they will make sure everything is arranged perfectly for you during your stay. A nice added benefit of staying with anna and maarten is that they know all the hotspots in town and will love to share this with you. I would highly recommend staying with Anna and maarten in their great place, chances are you don't want to leave upon their return...","relationship_type":"friend","relationship_type_text":"Friend","user_id":9605070}},"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"We had a really great stay at Amstel Delight!!  The flat was gorgeous, spacious and very bright with huge windows overlooking the canal.  We especially enjoyed the super sound system put throughout the flat, so that we could listen to music in any of the rooms.  The host was very welcoming and readily available to help.  Overall, a very positive experience.
