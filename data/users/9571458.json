Being outside in beautifull Amsterdam during summertime or baking cakes at home during wintertime. We would love to share these experiences with you. While we enjoy our other passion: travelling the world (hiking in the Himalaya, Andes or Alpes, skiing in the Alpes discovering other cultures in Asia, Europe, South-America) we invite you to stay in our home. We recently rebuild the place which we are proud of. Therefor we are only interested in careful guests.
