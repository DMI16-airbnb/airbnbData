The kitchen and the bathroom were nicely equipped, we've really had everything we wished for (and more!) during our stay.\r\n\r\nInge & John were the perfect hosts, giving us a warm welcome, showing us around in the flat and prepared to answer all our questions regarding the city as well. Additionally, free pamphlets and maps were available for us.\r\nInge was also super helpful with our extra needs - finding stores and restaurants which offer gluten- and lactose-free items. Furthermore, she kept checking up on us during our stay to ensure we have everything we need and was very responsive whenever we had a question.\r\n\r\nThe location is super nice, on the shore of Amstel, still very close to the downtown (t recommend them enough to anyone who is looking for an awesome place to stay with a unique Amsterdam touch and true hospitality.","created_at":"2016-07-04T01:13:29Z","id":83594930,"listing_id":13072410,"reviewee_id":28670581,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"István","has_profile_pic":true,"id":45315991,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/7f86f1f6-122b-4d6c-87ac-7d47a55aa598.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/7f86f1f6-122b-4d6c-87ac-7d47a55aa598.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":45315991,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":13072410,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.34994874661904,"lng":4.912196085010514,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3f9e2ebd-25b9-4d29-87f7-308d52b79029.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"NEW Studio located at the Amstel river","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3f9e2ebd-25b9-4d29-87f7-308d52b79029.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":78,"price_formatted":"$80","price_native":80,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3f9e2ebd-25b9-4d29-87f7-308d52b79029.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Inge","has_profile_pic":true,"id":28670581,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/0c928092-dea2-4426-bfd9-4b843a92e5c4.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/0c928092-dea2-4426-bfd9-4b843a92e5c4.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":28670581,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3f9e2ebd-25b9-4d29-87f7-308d52b79029.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Inge","has_profile_pic":true,"id":28670581,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/0c928092-dea2-4426-bfd9-4b843a92e5c4.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/0c928092-dea2-4426-bfd9-4b843a92e5c4.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":1,"total_listings_count":2,"work":""}
