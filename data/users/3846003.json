Carlos is working as a scientist and Patri as an editor. We read, like wine, practice meditation, yoga and running. We enjoy multicultural environments, are very open and love to meet new people from around the world. We take good care of our plants and our guests, and so far we have no kids and no pets.\r\n\r\nWe will be traveling some times so we would like to introduce P&C friends. In our profile pictures you will see Maria, Luciano and Ana, who will take care of welcoming you in our LoveNest whenever we are away.

The room I was provided is not huge but still very nice and comfortable. The hosts are cool - positive and clever, interesting to talk with. They know the city perfectly and always to share  some tips. Locations is great - quite and beautiful neighborhood but just 15 min walk from the all city madness, metro and tram are just 1 min away!! \r\nI would strongly recommend this place to young couples looking for the good place with rest reasonable price!","relationship_type":"travel_buddy","relationship_type_text":"Travel Buddy","user_id":3846003}},"recent_review":null,"school":"Colegio Berchmans, Fundación Universitaria Konrad Lorenz, Universidad Católica de Colombia, FUKL, University of Guadalajara, Ruhr-Universitaet Bochum, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":3,"work":"Netherlands Royal Academy of Sciences, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience"}
