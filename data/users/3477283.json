It is well decorated, spacious and very comfortable. And the best part is her place is very central, in a lovely part of Amsterdam with many cafes, restaurants and things to do; also very close to public transport. Sule is a well organized host and surely her apartment will make you feel home.","relationship_type":"colleague","relationship_type_text":"Colleague","user_id":3477283}},"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Sule's apartment was clean and spacious. Its location is near the center depending on where you want to go. Tram is right across the street and the metro is just right around the corner. So it is quite a convenient place for travelers. Everything is there in the apartment. Kitchen and bathroom stuff are all there. You just need to bring your change of clothes. There's even food in the fridge and cupboards for the guest consumption. In case you need something more there's a grocery about 5 min walk.\nIt's just quite a climb going to the place because it is located on the 3rd floor. If your a health buff that is a positive thing. \nOne more thing about the apartment, I think it needs more furniture and lights. But it's a minor thing. \nOverall, I would stay here again and recommend it to future guest. \n","created_at":"2016-06-06T11:31:12Z","id":78354731,"listing_id":1396297,"reviewee_id":3477283,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Roman","has_profile_pic":true,"id":57849097,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d4a48b27-9fc4-462d-ae53-f5e5732d4d7d.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d4a48b27-9fc4-462d-ae53-f5e5732d4d7d.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":57849097,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":1396297,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.36180498518298,"lng":4.90871692575595,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/93675854/0b340b28_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Top location - Newly decorated","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/93675854/0b340b28_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":223,"price_formatted":"$230","price_native":230,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/93675854/0b340b28_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Sule","has_profile_pic":true,"id":3477283,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/3477283/profile_pic/1346840716/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/3477283/profile_pic/1346840716/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":3477283,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/93675854/0b340b28_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Sule","has_profile_pic":true,"id":3477283,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/3477283/profile_pic/1346840716/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/3477283/profile_pic/1346840716/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Koc University, University of Amsterdam","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":2,"work":"Ernst and Young BV"}
