The apartment is great and in a really cool part of town. A walk to anything and right next to the Metro. I really liked the layout of the apartment as well. My colleague slept in the living room, but make sure you have a sleeping pad, because the couch is a little small. Great place, great neighborhood. Check out the bakery across the street!","created_at":"2016-04-26T01:50:46Z","id":71446003,"listing_id":11221414,"reviewee_id":58467931,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Dan","has_profile_pic":true,"id":44133134,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/78703bd6-e0a9-46a8-b102-92c3c64f11ea.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/78703bd6-e0a9-46a8-b102-92c3c64f11ea.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":44133134,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":11221414,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.361721141778425,"lng":4.909490530494361,"medium_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/41356141/3f390e65_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Design Space for 2 by the Amstel!","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/41356141/3f390e65_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":145,"price_formatted":"$149","price_native":149,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/41356141/3f390e65_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Bart","has_profile_pic":true,"id":58467931,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d7bf836d-3d44-4130-b46c-b5a8f9d12f24.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d7bf836d-3d44-4130-b46c-b5a8f9d12f24.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":58467931,"xl_picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/41356141/3f390e65_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Bart","has_profile_pic":true,"id":58467931,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d7bf836d-3d44-4130-b46c-b5a8f9d12f24.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d7bf836d-3d44-4130-b46c-b5a8f9d12f24.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
