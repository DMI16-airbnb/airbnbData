I love to live the good life, which is also visual in my very modern appartment. Currently I have a lot of free time, which gave me the opportunity to rent my appartment to others, who want to have an amazing experience in Amsterdam. I am always available for you if you have any questions about the city, the appartment or other things.

He didn't disturb me during whole period, but offered support in case I need something. Check in was fantastic , he explained me how everything works and passed me the key. The Apartment is new and it has everything to spend a great vacation in Amsterdam. It looks exactly like on photos. 2 minutes to supermarket, 5 to the downtown. In case you have a bike it could be parked in the garage. \r\nCheck-out was easy and simple. If you need a quiet and private place close to the city center that is the best spot to stay.","created_at":"2016-06-26T05:28:46Z","id":81971200,"listing_id":7316463,"reviewee_id":23703363,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Andrew","has_profile_pic":true,"id":42994098,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/626d3382-9a52-4141-919f-5aaa680ab8b1.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/626d3382-9a52-4141-919f-5aaa680ab8b1.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":42994098,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":7316463,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.37011703947627,"lng":4.905725524907206,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/66b48fc0-05cc-4c39-ab11-d070c5a1d5ee.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Luxury apartment with indoor pool","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/66b48fc0-05cc-4c39-ab11-d070c5a1d5ee.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":167,"price_formatted":"$172","price_native":172,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/66b48fc0-05cc-4c39-ab11-d070c5a1d5ee.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Sven","has_profile_pic":true,"id":23703363,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/23703363/profile_pic/1415900491/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/23703363/profile_pic/1415900491/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":23703363,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/66b48fc0-05cc-4c39-ab11-d070c5a1d5ee.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Sven","has_profile_pic":true,"id":23703363,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/23703363/profile_pic/1415900491/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/23703363/profile_pic/1415900491/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Nyenrode New Business School","signup_method":1,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
