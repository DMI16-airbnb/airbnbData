We love to travel (who doesn't) and try to get away from home anytime we can. Not that our little house on the canals isn't a great place to live.. there are just a million more places to explore! \r\n\r\nJasper teaches history and Renate is a director in theatre, with some teaching on the side. We are very interested in art, theatre, film and culture, but also love to spend time outside of the cities in rural areas, where there is plenty of nature to enjoy. Renate loves to cook and tries out every gluten free recepy she can find. Making being gluten-intolerant fun instead of a pain!
