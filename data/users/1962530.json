Relax, openminded, always helping you out with any question you might have.\r\nThe appartment, located in a very tranquil street, is very comfortable with a lot of natural light. It is really the ideal coming home place after a full day of crossing the typical streets and canals of Amsterdam. Public transport is nearby but on beautiful days the center is easily reached on foot passing by Brouwerij 't Ij (for a Natte or Zatte) or the giraffes and flamingo's from the Artis Zoo.
