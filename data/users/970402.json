He came looked for us at the metro station and brought us to the apartment. Beer and wine was waiting for us on arrival. The place is REALLY nice and very clean. It is very spacious and less than 10 minutes walk from the stores and restaurants in the downtown. Dave is a great guy and was very helpful by giving us tips and directions about Amsterdam. \n\nDave was very easy to reached if needed which is great.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone.","created_at":"2015-01-02T12:34:39Z","id":24721277,"listing_id":1513251,"reviewee_id":970402,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Jean","has_profile_pic":true,"id":13979539,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/058744be-ee13-4ff5-9605-ff27220f6ff0.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/058744be-ee13-4ff5-9605-ff27220f6ff0.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":13979539,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":1513251,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.36358574103992,"lng":4.905894623916838,"medium_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/22255122/62501991_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Luxury apartment in Canal District ","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/22255122/62501991_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":106,"price_formatted":"$109","price_native":109,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/22255122/62501991_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Dave","has_profile_pic":true,"id":970402,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/970402/profile_pic/1376289071/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/970402/profile_pic/1376289071/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":970402,"xl_picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/22255122/62501991_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Dave","has_profile_pic":true,"id":970402,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/970402/profile_pic/1376289071/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/970402/profile_pic/1376289071/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"University of Amsterdam","signup_method":1,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"KLM Royal Dutch Airlines"}
