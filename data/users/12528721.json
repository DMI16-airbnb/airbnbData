The apartment is spacious and beautiful.\r\n\r\nIt is close to Amstel station (5 minutes walk), and relatively close from the city center as well (15 minutes biking, no more!). And the way to the center is beautiful as you go along the Amstel river with its wonderful boat houses.\r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend it.\r\nThe area is calm and options like this one are the best plan to avoid the noisy streets of the busy city center!","created_at":"2016-05-09T03:15:24Z","id":73545704,"listing_id":11366315,"reviewee_id":12528721,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Marina","has_profile_pic":true,"id":4803098,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/2f71b7b6-a8b4-4916-9d63-9cae26f1df2f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/2f71b7b6-a8b4-4916-9d63-9cae26f1df2f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":4803098,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":11366315,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.34810908657579,"lng":4.92262763828718,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/17fea624-7d55-4358-9ce2-4f7817a39f4a.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Spacious apartment near Amstel","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/17fea624-7d55-4358-9ce2-4f7817a39f4a.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":99,"price_formatted":"$102","price_native":102,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/17fea624-7d55-4358-9ce2-4f7817a39f4a.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Laura","has_profile_pic":true,"id":12528721,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/183ebbe1-4fd1-4fe3-ad3f-75d5411e6bbf.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/183ebbe1-4fd1-4fe3-ad3f-75d5411e6bbf.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":12528721,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/17fea624-7d55-4358-9ce2-4f7817a39f4a.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Laura","has_profile_pic":true,"id":12528721,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/183ebbe1-4fd1-4fe3-ad3f-75d5411e6bbf.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/183ebbe1-4fd1-4fe3-ad3f-75d5411e6bbf.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"University of Amsterdam ","signup_method":1,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
