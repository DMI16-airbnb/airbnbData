The property was clean, modern and quiet, and Tanja provided lots of welcoming touches, from a chilled bottle of bubbly (that I'm so sorry we didn't get the chance to enjoy :( ) to chocolates. It's really quick and easy to get into the centre of Amsterdam on the metro but we generally walked everywhere - over to the Pijp and into the centre. We had such an amazing weekend and I fell in love with Amsterdam - I'll definitely be back! Thank you so much, Tanja, for everything, and to Luka for being so accommodating. Sorry I didn't get to meet either of you - next time!
