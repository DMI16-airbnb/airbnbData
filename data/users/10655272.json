It was clean tidy and spacious  perfectly  placed out of main tourist areas but close enough to get to the centre quickly via metro . Lots of  contact before the trip with kayleigh giving lots of information met her sister at the apartment  who was very friendly and offered lots of advice and guidance. Would be very happy to stay here again on next trip to the city and to recommend to friends","created_at":"2016-06-18T01:27:02Z","id":80323318,"listing_id":7838274,"reviewee_id":10655272,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Marie","has_profile_pic":true,"id":30192684,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/327a8639-b2fa-401f-a06e-c756a745ba61.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/327a8639-b2fa-401f-a06e-c756a745ba61.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":30192684,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":7838274,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.35045337732211,"lng":4.914070645450834,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/41b37cef-f3a9-44e6-a24c-9255ea609d47.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Comfortable Apartment Amsterdam","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/41b37cef-f3a9-44e6-a24c-9255ea609d47.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":111,"price_formatted":"$114","price_native":114,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/41b37cef-f3a9-44e6-a24c-9255ea609d47.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Kayleigh","has_profile_pic":true,"id":10655272,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/10655272/profile_pic/1439450480/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/10655272/profile_pic/1439450480/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":10655272,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/41b37cef-f3a9-44e6-a24c-9255ea609d47.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Kayleigh","has_profile_pic":true,"id":10655272,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/10655272/profile_pic/1439450480/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/10655272/profile_pic/1439450480/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":3,"work":""}
