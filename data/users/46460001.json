Everything was super clean. We had our concerns about the couch that turns into a bed but it was very comfertable. Also the boat is very close to the center so you don't have to take public transportation. We didn't really get in contact with the Host but we were very happy about the felxibility of him as we arrived in the morning and didn't have to wait around with our luggage.
