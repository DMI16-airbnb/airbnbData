The apartment is just a minute walk from the Wibautstraat metro station and it's really convenient to travel in a matter of few minutes to the center. On the other side, you can also take a walk along the Amstel river towards the center if you have time. There are also some very good restaurants around the locality.\r\n\r\nWe found the room very clean, bright and lively. She showed us around the house and told us we were free to use the kitchen and the sitting area if we needed. The bathroom was fresh, clean and very spacious. \r\n\r\nShe was kind enough to be flexible with the check-in and check-out as per our flight timings. She responded to our emails very quickly and shared a lot of information on what we can do once we arrived at Amsterdam. Overall we had a great stay and will not hesitate to stay at Pauline's apartment on our next trip to Amsterdam.","created_at":"2016-05-18T01:55:44Z","id":74929077,"listing_id":11486018,"reviewee_id":8899006,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Manoj","has_profile_pic":true,"id":459821,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/459821/profile_pic/1300934414/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/459821/profile_pic/1300934414/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":459821,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":11486018,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.35418695014952,"lng":4.911611078543207,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/7a4f252b-c36b-491b-b90f-0ba4afd71bfc.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Bright renovated room, no stairs!","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/7a4f252b-c36b-491b-b90f-0ba4afd71bfc.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":100,"price_formatted":"$103","price_native":103,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/7a4f252b-c36b-491b-b90f-0ba4afd71bfc.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Pauline","has_profile_pic":true,"id":8899006,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/f36b7907-be3e-4b6b-9852-c2c97830f37e.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/f36b7907-be3e-4b6b-9852-c2c97830f37e.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":8899006,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/7a4f252b-c36b-491b-b90f-0ba4afd71bfc.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Pauline","has_profile_pic":true,"id":8899006,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/f36b7907-be3e-4b6b-9852-c2c97830f37e.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/f36b7907-be3e-4b6b-9852-c2c97830f37e.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":1,"total_listings_count":2,"work":""}
