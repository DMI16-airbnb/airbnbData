Amsterdam feels like my hometown, although i grew up in a small village not far from the city.\nI live here with my husband Jan, who is Creative Director at a Content Strategy company, and our two sons Vos and Kees. I'm a projectmanager. We love to live, work, sport and play in the city. In the evening we like to have drink at the natural winebar, grab a bite in one of the numerous outstanding restaurants in the city, or go to the cinema. In the summer we head to swimmingpool with the kids, or take the bike and follow the river Amstel outside the city.","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["Deutsch","English","Fran√ßais","Nederlands"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Marjolein and her family are superb people. Polite, proper and educated. I only wish I could give them more than 5 stars. They had a bit of bad luck with the unusual El Nino weather here in Portugal but they managed to overcome that and still have a good time I hope. I strongly recommend them to any other host as I have no doubt that they will maintain their excellent status wherever they go. The house was left in an impeccable state and I only wish I could have got to know them a little better as unfortunately time did not allow.","created_at":"2016-06-05T02:47:22Z","id":77963914,"listing_id":null,"reviewee_id":4630778,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Arlindo","has_profile_pic":true,"id":12943866,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/12943866/profile_pic/1394361292/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/12943866/profile_pic/1394361292/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":12943866,"role":"host","listing":null,"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Marjolein","has_profile_pic":true,"id":4630778,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/8dbee236-a9d7-4a4f-962a-b34351d6013e.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/8dbee236-a9d7-4a4f-962a-b34351d6013e.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Alkwin Kollege, Hogeschool van Amsterdam","signup_method":1,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
