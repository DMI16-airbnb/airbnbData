It's the kind of city of love and it's the kind of person I am; I love the thrill and the quiet. \r\n\r\nI have always been fascinated by storytelling and political campaigning and managed to make a living out of this fascination. I have been working in the field of politics and campaigning for many years now and I was involved in legalizing airbnb in Amsterdam recently, a great project to work on for the city.\r\n\r\nFurthermore I love cinema, basketball, cooking, dining, wine, springtime and long walks. With the ones I love, of course. \r\n\r\nI started booking with airbnb 3 years ago and knowing the joy of staying in a great and homy place only recently (May 2014) decided to be part of the sharing economy all the way and share my place and knowledge of this city with like minded travelers around the world. I really do believe the sharing experience ads to the any stay, anywhere. \r\n\r\n \r\n","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":[],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Laila heeft drie nachten gelogeerd in la Sud.
