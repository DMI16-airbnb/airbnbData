We are classical musicians by profession, have lived in the US, Germany and London and travelled all over the world with our various chamber music groups and orchestras. Since our kids came along we opted for a more settled lifestyle; my husband took a steady job in an orchestra here and I teach at two conservatories and still travel a little bit for chamber music concerts here and there. The apartment is in the house where we live, but is completely separate. We are always available if you need help or advice with anything. We love living here in a quiet corner of this buzzing city- and after London this place is like a village with all the art and music and diversity of a metropolis!","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["Dansk","Deutsch","English","Français","Nederlands","Norsk","Svenska"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Asdis was a welcoming host!
