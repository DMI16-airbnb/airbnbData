Both Jennifer and Chad have full time jobs in technology, but their passion lies in travel, food and wine.  They have traveled quite a bit around the globe including the US, Canada, S. America, Europe, and Asia.  They love Amsterdam as their new home and are excited to share their canal studio apartment with visitors.  Hugo has built such a great reputation for De Korenbloemen and we will continue his tradition of providing a great accommodation for travelers.
