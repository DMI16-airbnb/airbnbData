The flat is very nice and had everything I needed - fast internet, washer & dryer, dishwasher... Even a nice balcony. \r\n\r\nI liked the area a lot. You can take a lovely walk along the Amstel river in to the city center and there is many nice restaurants with outdoor terraces. It's very convinient to rent a bike to get around the city as well. \r\n\r\nThe downsides are that the bedroom is very small and that you could hear the neighbours quite well. But I was not at home much and it was  quiet at night so you can have a good nights sleep. \r\n\r\nBernard responded quickly to questions and I found beers in the fridge and some very good local brand chocolate which was a nice touch. \r\n\r\nI would highly recommend this apartment.
