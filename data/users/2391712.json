The very spacious and tastefully furnished canal house close to the Amsterdam's city center is well equipped to make you feel at home the moment you step in. A true gem. Professional kitchen, premium audio and entertainment equipment, very comfy couch landscape and....oh my god...those leather chairs! \nThe beautiful garden rounds off the package.\n\nIt's possible to walk to the city center but the Metro is also around the corner. Groceries shopping can be done close by. \n\nIf you're exploring the city by boat on your own - which is a must (try (URL HIDDEN) -  it's possible to moor and board a boat 100m meters down the street.\n\nKarin was very kind, responsive and helpful as well as accomodating towards all our special requests. \nWe'd come back anytime. Thank you.","created_at":"2016-05-17T02:59:49Z","id":74782342,"listing_id":2845562,"reviewee_id":2391712,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Ronny","has_profile_pic":true,"id":6422155,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b4593f56-05b0-4548-b9e0-8013188f74e6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/b4593f56-05b0-4548-b9e0-8013188f74e6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":6422155,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":2845562,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.36275942047016,"lng":4.911489590589413,"medium_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/36860434/7dab5d01_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Double canal house Amsterdam Centre","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/36860434/7dab5d01_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":501,"price_formatted":"$516","price_native":516,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/36860434/7dab5d01_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Karin","has_profile_pic":true,"id":2391712,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/2391712/profile_pic/1398115226/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/2391712/profile_pic/1398115226/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":2391712,"xl_picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/36860434/7dab5d01_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Karin","has_profile_pic":true,"id":2391712,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/2391712/profile_pic/1398115226/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/2391712/profile_pic/1398115226/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Gymnasium Felisenum, University of Amsterdam","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
