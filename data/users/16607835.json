I work in real estate and Martine is a journalist and pr consultant. Dexter will be joining primary school soon.\r\n\r\nWe love to go to our cottage at the Vinkenveense Plassen in the summer, where we have a boat. It is 15 minutes from Amsterdam. But it is such a pity that our beautyfull house in Amsterdam is empty at these moments, so we decided to go on Airbnb.\r\n\r\nWe hope you love our house as much as we do!","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["Deutsch","English"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"We have just came back from Amsterdam and wanted to share with you our amazing experience from our staying at Martine and Richard's apartment. \r\nThe place is magnificent. Beautifully designed. Very comfort, clean and well organised - for adults as well as for kids.\r\nWe were 7 people at the apartment, including our 3 kids (10, 8, 3). We enjoyed the place very much and  felt at home. The kids were  thrilled with the wonderful toys and were simply happy.\r\nNo doubt that Martine and Richard's apartment will be our first choice in Amsterdam.
