We booked last minute, and Erik was so helpful and accommodating. The apartment is spacious, bright and elegant, and within easy reach of the city centre ( a 20 minute walk, or the train station is 5 minutes away). Such lovely, generous and helpful hosts. Communication was excellent, and check in was wonderfully easy.  We felt very much at home, and thoroughly recommend Erik`s apartment  .
