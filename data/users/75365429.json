We have been living in Amsterdam for the last 3 years, and in that time have taken the opportunity to actively travel within Europe. We have been avid users to AirBnB to find local hosts during our travels, and have a unique holiday experience. We now look forward to hosting you in our unique home in Amsterdam. We have loved living in the city center as it is near to all the popular attractions. We hope that you will also have a great experience in the city and create nice memories living in our charming canal house","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":[],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"A lovely apartment, clean, spacious, a well stocked kitchen if you want to cook and centrally located, Check in, instructions, key collection and communication with Manav were all perfect.
