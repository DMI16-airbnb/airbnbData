Not only is the houseboat great, but Steven is a wonderful host. The photos of this home speak for themselves. They are an accurate depiction of this place. It's a beautiful, modern space right on the Amstel. The house is fully equipped with everything you could possibly need. We felt so at home at Stevens place. \r\nWhen we arrived Steven welcomed us and told us all about the houseboat, he had a few things in the fridge for us and even offered a private boat tour of the canals. He is spectacular and so is his home, this place is not to be missed!","created_at":"2016-06-06T02:10:37Z","id":78155351,"listing_id":1079499,"reviewee_id":5937460,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Lanette","has_profile_pic":true,"id":24838618,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/c009a0fe-6503-41ca-87c0-938b5835e2c2.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/c009a0fe-6503-41ca-87c0-938b5835e2c2.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":24838618,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":1079499,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.35458776928744,"lng":4.908418668276321,"medium_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/17377005/0cd947da_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Unique Houseboat Amsterdam Center","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/17377005/0cd947da_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":522,"price_formatted":"$538","price_native":538,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/17377005/0cd947da_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Steven","has_profile_pic":true,"id":5937460,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/5937460/profile_pic/1366051724/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/5937460/profile_pic/1366051724/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":5937460,"xl_picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/17377005/0cd947da_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Steven","has_profile_pic":true,"id":5937460,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/5937460/profile_pic/1366051724/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/5937460/profile_pic/1366051724/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":" Leiden University","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
