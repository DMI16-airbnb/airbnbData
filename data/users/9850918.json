Interested in art, cooking and eating, ballet, spirituality and the diversity of cultures, I am always curious for new experiences and new people. My apartment represents my interests as a cosy, pleasant gathering of ethnic, modern and antique furniture, a light, sunny and quiet place to recover from a busy weekend in the city.","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["English","Fran√ßais","Italiano","Nederlands"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Our host Dunja was at the apartment waiting for us when we arrived.  She was patient as we were slightly delayed in arriving to the apartment.  The apartment was perfect for our stay.  Spacious and very well decorated.  Made it feel very cozy in comparison to staying at a hotel.  The fridge and washer were a big bonus for us as well as the two large balconies.  The bed was comfortable as well.  Dunja was very kind leaving us bread and jams for breakfast.  She also left us chocolates in our initials, which was very sweet of her to do.  Nothing bad to say.  Wonderful host, great apartment.  3 minute walk to the metro, very convenient.  I would most definitely stay here again!","created_at":"2015-10-24T17:36:17Z","id":51794069,"listing_id":1896081,"reviewee_id":9850918,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Vanessa","has_profile_pic":true,"id":43688047,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/43688047/profile_pic/1444052488/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/43688047/profile_pic/1444052488/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":43688047,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":1896081,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.352251548778476,"lng":4.91574345913946,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/76127201/4d38aa30_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Charming and sunny appt for 2!
