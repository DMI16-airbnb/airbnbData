It was perfectly located for our needs and very convenient to access the center of the city, as well as an easy trip to Schipol airport. The apartment was spacious, comfortable, and clean, and there were lovely treats awaiting us. One thing to note is that we could not find a space to hang clothing, but there was a spare bed to lay out our clothes. \r\n\r\nEven though we did not get the chance to meet Jelte, he was very quick to respond to any requests or questions and their neighbors were accessible to get the keys and nearby in case of any issues. We'd be happy to recommend this great apartment for your Amsterdam stay!
