Got in just fine, thanks to nice map.  \r\n\r\nThe location couldn't be better, across the canal from Le Hermitage; around the corner from Jewish Museum and Opera/Ballet, short stroll to Dam and Centraal.  But, you must understand that this is a very small studio, L-shaped, about 3m x 7m, just what you see in the main photo, plus a nice bathroom.  But, the toilet seat was broken and even though Kokki sent someone to look at it, they couldn't fix it.  She said she ordered a replacement, but that didn't help my stay.\r\n\r\nAlso, the listing claims Laptop Friendly, but be warned that there is no power receptacle near the small table, and the folding chair is not comfortable.  If you need to spend time at the keyboard while here, plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nBut the real feature of this place is the location; you can't ask for better.  There is a small grocer around the block, along with restaurants, Metro station, tram & bus stops, cafe & pub.\r\n\r\nThe courtyard outside the door is cute, the bed is serviceable, the telly works, albeit limited channels, the sofa is small but usable.  Kitchen is just a single cabinet with sink, fridge and hob, but fridge is useful.  No oven or microwave.","created_at":"2016-07-02T09:12:43Z","id":83294976,"listing_id":6081376,"reviewee_id":31566164,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Nic","has_profile_pic":true,"id":28510607,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/28510607/profile_pic/1443370220/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/28510607/profile_pic/1443370220/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":28510607,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":6081376,"instant_bookable":true,"lat":52.36783613176123,"lng":4.904006221550716,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/50095bf3-3051-4818-97ac-2eb439d0f524.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"1 P Studio City Bungalow","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/50095bf3-3051-4818-97ac-2eb439d0f524.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":78,"price_formatted":"$80","price_native":80,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/50095bf3-3051-4818-97ac-2eb439d0f524.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Kokki","has_profile_pic":true,"id":31566164,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d2251c2b-8836-4f62-9c90-ba521a0bf234.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d2251c2b-8836-4f62-9c90-ba521a0bf234.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":31566164,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/50095bf3-3051-4818-97ac-2eb439d0f524.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Kokki","has_profile_pic":true,"id":31566164,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d2251c2b-8836-4f62-9c90-ba521a0bf234.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d2251c2b-8836-4f62-9c90-ba521a0bf234.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
