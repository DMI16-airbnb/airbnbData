I came to Amsterdam to study hospitality management and business, but after finishing my degree I realized it is not my dream to work in the hospitality industry but have found myself working with sales in the tech industry. I have a great passion for food, drinks and good service. I have been living in the city centre of Amsterdam for almost 6 years. I love this city and have many good tips for a great time. I am currently living with my boyfriend and am therefore a host on Airbnb.","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["English","Svenska"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":null,"school":"Viktor Rydberg Gymnasium, Stockholm University, Kulturama, Hotelschool The Hague","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
