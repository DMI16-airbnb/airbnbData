Everything was as described and lovely. Perhaps the best part was enjoying the music room in the late afternoon with sun flooding in the windows and a perfect view of the water. The grand piano is in lovely condition.\r\n\r\nTaco and Robert are like the fun cool creative kids everyone wants to be friends with in school. \r\n\r\nWill we ever be able to stay anyplace else in Amsterdam after this visit? We think maybe not!\r\n\r\nThank you for a lovely, wonderful visit in your delightful townhouse. \r\n\r\nJoy To You !!\r\n\r\nJason\r\n& Ken\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: The rear garden is a fabulous treat in Amsterdam and the location is perfect!","created_at":"2016-05-04T00:55:17Z","id":72529182,"listing_id":1397317,"reviewee_id":7547999,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Jason","has_profile_pic":true,"id":28861796,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/28861796/profile_pic/1443411818/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/28861796/profile_pic/1443411818/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":28861796,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":1397317,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.35771179617606,"lng":4.906761171915755,"medium_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/21362527/09aa9eff_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Monumental river-house + backyard","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/21362527/09aa9eff_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":267,"price_formatted":"$275","price_native":275,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/21362527/09aa9eff_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Taco","has_profile_pic":true,"id":7547999,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/7547999/profile_pic/1374676638/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/7547999/profile_pic/1374676638/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":7547999,"xl_picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/21362527/09aa9eff_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Taco","has_profile_pic":true,"id":7547999,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/7547999/profile_pic/1374676638/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/7547999/profile_pic/1374676638/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"Taco is director/programmer Movies that Matter Festival and Robert a freelance production designer"}
