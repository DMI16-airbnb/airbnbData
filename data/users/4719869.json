I work as a general doctor in a pediatrics department, hoping to become a pediatrician one day! In my spare time I play in a women's soccer team, I run (2 times a half marathon, yay!) and I like to go snowboarding. Besides that I like meeting up with friends for dinner or parties, or I kick back with a good book or television series (Homeland, Suits, Breaking Bad, etc.). \r\n\r\nWhenever there is time and money left, I want to travel a lot. I've been to a lot of countries so far, but a lot is never enough! ;-) When I am home though, I am more than happy to host you in my apartment in Amsterdam, because meeting new interesting people is also something I am fond of. Hopefully we'll see each other soon!\r\n\r\nAnne","friends_count":1,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["English","Nederlands"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":{"recommendation":{"created_at":"2015-03-14T12:46:52Z","id":431161,"left_by_user":{"user":{"first_name":"Eve","has_profile_pic":true,"id":22440616,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/22440616/profile_pic/1413130975/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/22440616/profile_pic/1413130975/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","acceptance_rate":"N/A","created_at":"2014-10-12T16:22:53Z","identity_verified":false,"is_superhost":false,"picture_large_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/22440616/profile_pic/1413130975/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_large","recommendation_count":0,"response_rate":"N/A","response_time":"N/A","reviewee_count":2,"thumbnail_medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/22440616/profile_pic/1413130975/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_medium"}},"recommendation":"Staying at Anne's place was a pleasure!

We unfortunately not met Anne but she seems to be very sympathetic. The way to City centre is a bit long by walk (30 min) but the way is so beautiful that we forget this ! Metro station at 200 meters which join the Central Station in 5 min.
