The apartment we rent out is our former home from before the children were born. We have enjoyed the penthouse ever so much. It was our little tree house up in the sky with an unbeatable view.\r\n\r\nWhen we go on holiday, or a city trip,  we always book an apartment. It is always a surprise what you will get. And it feels so good if you booked the right one.\r\n\r\nThis is the same experience that we would like to provide our guests that rent our magic penthouse.","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["English","Español","Français","Nederlands"],"listings_count":2,"location":"Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Our flight into Amsterdam arrived early in the morning and Stacey was super accommodating and let us arrive early and drop off our bags so we could go exploring. The place was super clean and worked perfectly for the two of us. I also commented how comfortable the bed was (we'd recently stayed a few places where that was not the case!). Super convenient location for exploring the city (note this also means it can be a little noisy, we were there Friday and Saturday night).
