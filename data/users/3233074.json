We traveled from Sweden to Amsterdam and experienced flight delay, thus resulting in a later-than-usual check-in at about 2230. Daniel was readily available via phone and responded to my messages promptly. When we arrived at the store to pick up the keys to the BnB, we were introduced to a few of the staff working in Il Sogno. They were cleaning up the shop in preparation to close for the day, but they were still in great spirits and engaged us in conversation. Daniel brought us up to the BnB, which was probably just a 2 minutes walk from the store, and even gave us many recommendations on where to go, what to do, what to eat. Daily breakfast was served in the store as well except on the last day (Thursday) as they were opened much later. The staff offered to whip up some food for us, or even to reimburse for our breakfast spent elsewhere. There was a pub just below us and it was very lively and loud on the last night we were there as Sweden was up against Belgium in the Euro Cup and everyone was just cheering and enjoying as they watched the match together. We didn't get to sleep much that night due to he noise, but it was rather a surreal experience to be caught right in!
