We wanted something close to the center but something quiet at the same time.  Kees & Sophie's home fit the bill.  Excellent communication with Kees prior to arrival and a warm greeting from Sophie upon our arrival.  She gave us a list of \"local\" recommendations.  She went over the property in detail and left us to explore.  During our trip they were very communicative if we had any questions or concerns.  If you are looking to visit Amsterdam this home is  a must.  Quick from the airport and close to the metro.
