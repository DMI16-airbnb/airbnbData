Main bathroom is OK, shower is not very powerful. Small toilet sink tap is broken which was annoying. \n\nIt is a little outside of the centre and is a fair walk into town- not so good on nights out as we had to get a taxi back. Located in fairly residential area. \n\nApartment would benefit from a hairdryer and iron - essentials you would expect to have in an apartment! \n\nBed in bedroom is quite soft and there is no storage or space to put your clothes.\n\nApart from this Paul was very quick in responding and hospitable.
