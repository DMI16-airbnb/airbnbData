Welcome and very nice to meet you :-). \r\n\r\nLike you, I love travelling and love to meet people from all over the world. I currently work at the Dutch Central Bank, but have been working at the United Nations and the Royal Dutch Shell before. I love to provide a great experience for other people, especially from abroad! Hopefully, this will help me to prepare you for the best experience that you can wish for.\r\n\r\nI have been living in in most parts of Amsterdam for the past 10 years and can safely say that I know this city very well. I am happy to advise you about all aspects including the world famous canals, the countless museums, the great restaurants, the 'brown' bars and many other sites! Of course, I know the 'nobody-knows-about-them' hidden gems as well....\r\n\r\nPlease, feel welcome to reach out to me if you have any questions. I am already very much looking forward to being your host.","friends_count":1,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["Deutsch","English","Nederlands"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":{"recommendation":{"created_at":"2015-04-08T13:46:41Z","id":439467,"left_by_user":{"user":{"first_name":"Ra√Øsa","has_profile_pic":true,"id":10191578,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/0873175b-1712-4073-9e1f-453c58ee61c7.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/0873175b-1712-4073-9e1f-453c58ee61c7.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","acceptance_rate":"N/A","created_at":"2013-11-22T15:30:19Z","identity_verified":false,"is_superhost":false,"picture_large_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/0873175b-1712-4073-9e1f-453c58ee61c7.jpg?aki_policy=profile_large","recommendation_count":0,"response_rate":"N/A","response_time":"N/A","reviewee_count":3,"thumbnail_medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/0873175b-1712-4073-9e1f-453c58ee61c7.jpg?aki_policy=profile_medium"}},"recommendation":"One of the finest apartments in the city of Amsterdam. \r\nAlfred and I have been close friends for years and I have the pleasure of visiting this charming apartment on a regular basis. Secretly, I wish I could live here myself. And when Alfred would ever leave the apartment, I will move in within a heartbeat (he knows that). \r\nIt's the perfect place: centrally located, very bright and spacious (I love the high ceilings and ornaments), fully equipped kitchen, and next to so many nice cafes and restaurants. \r\nStaying here would take your Amsterdam experience to the next level, since you're in the middle of the most beautiful (and non-touristy) part of the city. \r\nYou can have the perfect holiday: start your day with some toast in the sunny living room, go for a morning stroll along the Amstel River (next to the apartment), relax with a nice cup of coffee at one of the local cafes, and head to the museums/shops/canals after that. Experience Amsterdam nightlife or have a (romantic) dinner in one of the restaurants near by, although almost everything is reachable within 15 minutes. \r\nThis apartment accommodates the ideal city trip for sure.
