It is exactly as advertised. Spacious, scenic and in the part of town we were looking to stay. Although we really only spent time sleeping in the apartment, it was just what we were looking for just a couple blocks from where some friends were staying. It was in a great part of town steps from the Amstel and at a subway stop that was four stops from the Centraal station. The directions they gave me to get there from the airport were perfect. I want to add some additional thanks to Asterid's friend, who came by to pick up the key quite early on the morning of our departure, as our flight left pretty early in the day!","created_at":"2015-09-24T14:05:33Z","id":48215544,"listing_id":480245,"reviewee_id":2378237,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Derek","has_profile_pic":true,"id":43529630,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/43529630/profile_pic/1441575126/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/43529630/profile_pic/1441575126/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":43529630,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":480245,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.35408510547038,"lng":4.912887311384521,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/5971073/8781b95e_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Cosy apartment along the Amstel.","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/5971073/8781b95e_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":134,"price_formatted":"$138","price_native":138,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/5971073/8781b95e_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Rachelle","has_profile_pic":true,"id":2378237,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/2378237/profile_pic/1337090859/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/2378237/profile_pic/1337090859/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":2378237,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/5971073/8781b95e_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Rachelle","has_profile_pic":true,"id":2378237,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/2378237/profile_pic/1337090859/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/2378237/profile_pic/1337090859/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Bisschoppelijk College, Universiteit van Amsterdam","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"Varova Investments, ABN AMRO, Freelancer"}
