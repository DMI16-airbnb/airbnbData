We had a great time in this comfortable, beautifully decorated, and well-located home. Every morning we enjoyed coffee on the deck, watching the boats and crew teams row by. Nicole and her husband provided maps and recommendations to some nearby places to eat and shop, and even rented bikes to us (super-convenient, and biking around the city is so much fun).  \r\n\r\nWe'll be back in Amsterdam to visit our family soon, and we hope to stay here again. Very highly recommended! \r\n\r\nThank you for a wonderful introduction to Amsterdam.
