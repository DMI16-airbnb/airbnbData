The apartment gives me the finances and time to work on my projects. A perfect combination. \r\nI love to travel: I went on a trip of two years through South America, from Chile to Colombia. I've learned a lot and returned all the stronger and wiser. It will definitely not be my last journey.\r\nI will do my best to make your stay as comfortable as possible, so you can enjoy Amsterdam to the fullest. I live in the apartment above so don't hesitate to ask for anything.  I'll always try to help.\r\nMy study demands a lot of time, so it is impossible to handle everything from the apartment myself. I arranged my friend Guido to handle the check-ins. He's currently applying for a musical theater school and is doing some theater projects as well.\r\nI'll still be living in the apartment above yours so we will definitely meet as well.","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["English","Espa√±ol","Nederlands"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":null,"school":"National Film and Television Academy (NFTA)","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"Freelance Director and Cinematographer"}
