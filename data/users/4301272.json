Flight to Amsterdam got delayed but that was no problem, and Milou even interrupted her dinner to come and give the key and show the flat.  \r\nThe flat is very pleasant, with everything one would need, and has a very nice outside area which is definitely a plus for those who smoke.\r\nMilou is the most easygoing host and very accommodating and understanding.\r\nThank you Milou for a great stay and for being such a great host!
