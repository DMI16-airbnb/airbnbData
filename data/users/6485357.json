Not only was it accurately portrayed on the airbnb site, the views from the living room windows and from the roof deck were stunning.  (We were there for New Year's eve and the night of fireworks was unlike anything we had ever witnessed.)\r\nOur two bedrooms were roomy and comfortable, the living room was a great place to hang out and read, and the kitchen was big enough to cook dinner for our family of three and a couple of friends one night.  Monica warned us about Amsterdam's steep staircases, but it wasn't a big problem.  Hauling the suitcases up and down was the only difficulty, and we only had to do that once, each way.  However, for older folks I would recommend holding on to the handrail when descending the major staircase.\r\nEven though I enjoyed strolling through the canal district (I just love those house barges) I was glad to find our apartment a little out of the main, intensely trafficked tourist area and, instead, right on the Amstel river.  Walking about was easy and taking the tram became a breeze for getting about.  Watch out for those bike lanes!\r\nWhat was really great about Monica's apartment were the architectural details and Monica's personal interior choices.  You really felt like you were staying in a home that was truly loved, and not in a hotel.\r\nThe only complaint we had (and it is very minor) was that the internet reception was rather spotty, for us, anyway.  But, stepping outside to the waterfront or going to a local cafe got us all we needed.\r\nThanks so much, Monica.  We enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam and being at your place had a lot to do with it.\r\nDavid Vaughn, and family\r\n","created_at":"2016-01-05T13:24:02Z","id":58808448,"listing_id":2912309,"reviewee_id":6485357,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"David","has_profile_pic":true,"id":22531980,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/22531980/profile_pic/1441422430/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/22531980/profile_pic/1441422430/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":22531980,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":2912309,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.35298389353063,"lng":4.907670668632414,"medium_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/38629624/5f8ac448_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Spacious house + rooftop terrace !","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/38629624/5f8ac448_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":278,"price_formatted":"$286","price_native":286,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/38629624/5f8ac448_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Monica","has_profile_pic":true,"id":6485357,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/6485357/profile_pic/1398770520/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/6485357/profile_pic/1398770520/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":6485357,"xl_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/38629624/5f8ac448_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Monica","has_profile_pic":true,"id":6485357,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/6485357/profile_pic/1398770520/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/6485357/profile_pic/1398770520/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":1,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"MangalaM meditation&yoga + Samyama-Yoga Naarden"}
