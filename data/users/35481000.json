Running my own private practice in the centre of Amsterdam, visited mostly by visual artists, lawyers, physicians, journalists and entrepreneurs and working for a foreign company like Compsych to attend to their Dutch based clientele. From time to time I let the beautiful apartment at the canal, right beneath where I live. And sometimes I also let my gorgeous spacious farmhouse in France.

The central location is only enhanced by how nice the apartment is. We found it very comfortable, nicely decorated and almost too tempting to spend rainy mornings watching the canal outside with a coffee from the window. The street is remarkably quiet for how close to the centre the apartment is and it was so easy to walk to almost any museum or sight in under fifteen minutes. Hugo very kindly provided us with a list of places to see and eat as well as a well stocked kitchen and making arrival so easy, it's only ten minutes to central station, I'd recommend staying here very highly.","created_at":"2016-03-09T08:09:21Z","id":64929679,"listing_id":6786864,"reviewee_id":35481000,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Peter","has_profile_pic":true,"id":39257753,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/35ed8582-d7c4-415d-8dea-fba0f8ff533a.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/35ed8582-d7c4-415d-8dea-fba0f8ff533a.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":39257753,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":6786864,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.36963298075036,"lng":4.89813158599366,"medium_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/85877237/265d6c56_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"At The Canal Spacious And Beautiful","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/85877237/265d6c56_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":166,"price_formatted":"$171","price_native":171,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/85877237/265d6c56_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Hugo","has_profile_pic":true,"id":35481000,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/35481000/profile_pic/1433960202/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/35481000/profile_pic/1433960202/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":35481000,"xl_picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/85877237/265d6c56_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Hugo","has_profile_pic":true,"id":35481000,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/35481000/profile_pic/1433960202/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/35481000/profile_pic/1433960202/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Rijnlands Lyceum, UVA","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":2,"work":"Psychologist"}
