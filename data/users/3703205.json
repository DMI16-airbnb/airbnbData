She lives in a beautiful street, just like me :-). To her guests I can see she is very kind and hospitable. But not only to her guests. When we are having a meeting with the neighbours she always invites us to her place and takes care of us with some food and drinks. So if your thinking of visiting Judith, don't hesitate; kindness, hospitality and location are key words. And you can cycle around the city with included bikes!","relationship_type":"friend","relationship_type_text":"Friend","user_id":3703205}},"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"We had a very pleasant stay with Judith. The room was a little small, but you also have access to a roomy balcony. The new kitten, Charlie was absolutely adorable and was very playful as well! The arrival process was easy, and the apartment was located conveniently right near a metro station.","created_at":"2016-06-20T00:44:27Z","id":80682526,"listing_id":719143,"reviewee_id":3703205,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Angela","has_profile_pic":true,"id":34582922,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/34582922/profile_pic/1440066888/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/34582922/profile_pic/1440066888/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":34582922,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":719143,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.353373350478165,"lng":4.914871608983302,"medium_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/10037774/659a6187_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Central, balcony, WIFI, free bikes!","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/10037774/659a6187_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":56,"price_formatted":"$58","price_native":58,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/10037774/659a6187_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Judith","has_profile_pic":true,"id":3703205,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/3703205/profile_pic/1348872365/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/3703205/profile_pic/1348872365/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":3703205,"xl_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/10037774/659a6187_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Judith","has_profile_pic":true,"id":3703205,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/3703205/profile_pic/1348872365/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/3703205/profile_pic/1348872365/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"KGL, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Bar-Ilan University","signup_method":1,"total_listings_count":3,"work":"archivist"}
