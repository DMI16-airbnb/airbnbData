I have turned 2 rooms into a beautiful B&B. It is modern and industrial with a classic touch and new combined with old, secondhand, selfmade furniture, bricabrac and other details. \r\n\r\n\r\nI call my B&B beautiful not only because i think it is so ( I did it all myself with friends and must say we did a PRETTY good job here!) \r\nI bought beautiful things, in different countries and some Redisigncled ;-), with love... \r\nAnd if you like something as much as I do, you can buy it! because a lot of my beautiful things are for sale.\r\n\r\nI believe in beauty in many ways, I like it that I am not in a very fancy, expencive and obviosly also beautiful, neighbourhood. \r\nBut in a multicultural one that has it's own beauties and many of them. \r\nAlso I like working with different materials, wood , fabic, stone, witch all have a beautiful structure of there own. \r\nI love the beatiful trees in my street for as the street it self isn't that nice, love that contrast. The big older concreet buildings around the corner of my street, witch a lot of people think are ugly but I think they are beautiful and now even more so because they all have a new destination, so you can go visite them, to enjoy a drink or meal and have a beautiful time in a beautiful environment. \r\nAnd last but not least; I want everyone to have a beautiful time in my B&B and beautiful Amsterdam and I wil do my best to make your stay as beautiful as possible.","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":[],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Une chambre très belle une hôte à la perfection.
