The locality is quite and peaceful. The house was in good condition. The bathroom especially is great. It accommodates two in the main bedroom, one on the second (smaller) bedroom and one on the couch. The wifi was pretty slow. Since this is located in Amsterdam Central, the price is slightly high.","created_at":"2016-05-31T00:44:48Z","id":77091215,"listing_id":898310,"reviewee_id":4793520,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Anirudh","has_profile_pic":true,"id":41020432,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/41020432/profile_pic/1439230728/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/41020432/profile_pic/1439230728/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":41020432,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":898310,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.359235439828744,"lng":4.913931230413626,"medium_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/16711397/b1a755b9_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Lovely & completely new apartment ","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/16711397/b1a755b9_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":177,"price_formatted":"$182","price_native":182,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/16711397/b1a755b9_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Stephanie","has_profile_pic":true,"id":4793520,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d7594f29-5c26-44ae-bc8d-ed4fbd3ba652.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d7594f29-5c26-44ae-bc8d-ed4fbd3ba652.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":4793520,"xl_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/16711397/b1a755b9_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Stephanie","has_profile_pic":true,"id":4793520,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d7594f29-5c26-44ae-bc8d-ed4fbd3ba652.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d7594f29-5c26-44ae-bc8d-ed4fbd3ba652.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":1,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"UNWOMEN Malawi "}
