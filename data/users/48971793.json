The apartment is stylishly decorated and very spacious with a really nice vibe, the garden is lovely too. There are some great places to eat and drink very near by as well as a good supermarket and a bicycle hire shop. The metro is also very close by giving easy access to the centre of town but I would recommend renting bikes and cycling everywhere, it's by far the quickest, easiest and nicest way to get around. I would love to come and stay here again sometime.","created_at":"2016-05-16T00:07:48Z","id":74362417,"listing_id":9450652,"reviewee_id":48971793,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Simon","has_profile_pic":true,"id":7361876,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/7361876/profile_pic/1373323599/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/7361876/profile_pic/1373323599/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":7361876,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":9450652,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.354662543823224,"lng":4.9101518458342435,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3eb52a56-ebe1-4c0c-a51f-f6401051315f.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Children's Paradise in Amsterdam","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3eb52a56-ebe1-4c0c-a51f-f6401051315f.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":334,"price_formatted":"$344","price_native":344,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3eb52a56-ebe1-4c0c-a51f-f6401051315f.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Maarten","has_profile_pic":true,"id":48971793,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/c0a2085d-5446-48e3-b195-924e1450e1f0.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/c0a2085d-5446-48e3-b195-924e1450e1f0.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":48971793,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3eb52a56-ebe1-4c0c-a51f-f6401051315f.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Maarten","has_profile_pic":true,"id":48971793,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/c0a2085d-5446-48e3-b195-924e1450e1f0.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/c0a2085d-5446-48e3-b195-924e1450e1f0.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
