All very well designed and luxuriously furnished. \r\nI love the stories my guests bring back to my apartments after spending a couple of days in Amsterdam. A lot of my guests come back for a second or third time and I have hosted friends of my guests as well.\r\nAmsterdam is a great city, and I made sure all my apartments are right in the heart of it! \r\nAmsterdamResidences, the perfect base to explore the city!

Only problem was that one of the sinks wasn't working and a few of the lights weren't working but apart from that, a lovely place in a great location.
