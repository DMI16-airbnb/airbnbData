From the time a made the booking request till the time of our departure from the apartment. She was so attentive to all of our requests and so helpful that made us feel like home even before we get to Amsterdam. Lydia's response was instant, which gave me the advantage of arranging my flights very quickly, and the rest of the trip's details.\r\nBy the time me and my girlfriend saw the pictures of the apartment, we had already made our mind to stay there. The cleanliness, the fully equipped kitchen, and very well designed facilities of each area of the studio offered us comfort and cosyness that made our holidays perfect!!\r\nThe location of the studio was perfect. City center was only 10 min away on foot. Metro station and tram stop just 5 min walk. As for restaurants, bars and cafeterias all around in a walking distance of 10-15 min.\r\n\r\nI definitely recommend the studio for very relaxing and enjoyable holidays in Amsterdam.","created_at":"2016-05-27T00:37:49Z","id":76306685,"listing_id":9963306,"reviewee_id":2109220,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Sotiris","has_profile_pic":true,"id":59705052,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/a36b8ac2-0f7e-4067-a112-f7d7fd546021.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/a36b8ac2-0f7e-4067-a112-f7d7fd546021.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":59705052,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":9963306,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.369762042592015,"lng":4.9044869283191215,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/12090830-57c2-4b56-bd15-5748caabc2ce.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Sunny Studio in City Center","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/12090830-57c2-4b56-bd15-5748caabc2ce.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":126,"price_formatted":"$130","price_native":130,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/12090830-57c2-4b56-bd15-5748caabc2ce.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Lydia","has_profile_pic":true,"id":2109220,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/590afa6e-353f-47cc-abcf-e2867dc8a8ee.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/590afa6e-353f-47cc-abcf-e2867dc8a8ee.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":2109220,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/12090830-57c2-4b56-bd15-5748caabc2ce.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Lydia","has_profile_pic":true,"id":2109220,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/590afa6e-353f-47cc-abcf-e2867dc8a8ee.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/590afa6e-353f-47cc-abcf-e2867dc8a8ee.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":3,"work":""}
