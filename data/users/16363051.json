A bit far if not mobile but easily accessible on foot otherwise. Kitchen well equipped and fabulous bathroom. Comfortable bed. Erik-Jan was super responsive to any of my enquiries and very friendly. Even provided me with the grocery discount card and a travel chip card which was very useful!\r\nJust one warning: the staircase is very narrow and steep; don't bring oversize luggage!","created_at":"2015-05-16T12:09:22Z","id":32228334,"listing_id":3232933,"reviewee_id":16363051,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Claire","has_profile_pic":true,"id":11420968,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/11420968/profile_pic/1425123833/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/11420968/profile_pic/1425123833/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":11420968,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":3232933,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.353069693424295,"lng":4.907642675111012,"medium_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/41095624/4f834943_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Gorgeous appartment","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/41095624/4f834943_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":132,"price_formatted":"$136","price_native":136,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/41095624/4f834943_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Erik-Jan","has_profile_pic":true,"id":16363051,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/16363051/profile_pic/1401880139/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/16363051/profile_pic/1401880139/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":16363051,"xl_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/41095624/4f834943_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Erik-Jan","has_profile_pic":true,"id":16363051,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/16363051/profile_pic/1401880139/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/16363051/profile_pic/1401880139/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Het Hogeland College","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
