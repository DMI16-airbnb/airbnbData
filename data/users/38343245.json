This houseboat is perfectly appointed, comfortable, spotless and a joy to relax in while watching boats and birds floating by on this quiet canal. It was so beautiful and calming, we found it difficult to pry ourselves away to do sightseeing.  It is not often that your accommodations can be a highlight of your trip!  Should we return to Amsterdam, I would be thrilled to stay on this houseboat again.  Anne was prompt in her communications and extremely accommodating of our unusual schedule.  Overall, I cannot say enough about this boat or its charming hosts.","created_at":"2016-07-05T09:05:52Z","id":84045935,"listing_id":13114027,"reviewee_id":38343245,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Sarah","has_profile_pic":true,"id":5697196,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3227ba53-92be-408e-91ce-e9458a8c7400.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3227ba53-92be-408e-91ce-e9458a8c7400.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":5697196,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":13114027,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.36208197559171,"lng":4.904003530348131,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3915c07b-e851-4d12-88dc-ee5b86b203cc.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Houseboat on the canal","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3915c07b-e851-4d12-88dc-ee5b86b203cc.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":223,"price_formatted":"$230","price_native":230,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3915c07b-e851-4d12-88dc-ee5b86b203cc.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Anne","has_profile_pic":true,"id":38343245,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/1e99eeb2-0382-4ab2-b539-15e732868313.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/1e99eeb2-0382-4ab2-b539-15e732868313.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":38343245,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3915c07b-e851-4d12-88dc-ee5b86b203cc.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Anne","has_profile_pic":true,"id":38343245,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/1e99eeb2-0382-4ab2-b539-15e732868313.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/1e99eeb2-0382-4ab2-b539-15e732868313.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"Midwife"}
