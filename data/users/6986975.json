I am a musician and lawyer. Momentarily I tour through Holland with a succesful Dutch Caberatier. I love to make (jazz) music, to read, to travel, to racebike, hike in the mountains, skiing, sailing, golf, running and to have drinks with friends in cosy typical Amsterdam bars. I like to arrange things\r\nwell. \r\n\r\nI would like to welcome you in my houseboat on the river Amstel in Amsterdam. I know a lot about Amsterdam, I have been living here for 10 years now. You won't regret it!","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["Deutsch","English","Fran√ßais","Nederlands"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"We had a great stay on Erik's houseboat and would stay there again in a heartbeat. The houseboat and accommodations matched the description very well.  It was just what we needed for 4 people, and it was very clean.  Location was great, relatively quiet, but close to good restaurants and walking distance to tourist destinations. Although we did not meet Erik in person, his communication throughout was top-notch: he replied quickly to questions and called/texted when he had a change of plans for the handoff of keys. As guests, we felt very well taken care of. Next time we visit Amsterdam, we hope to stay here again!","created_at":"2016-05-22T01:18:31Z","id":75437116,"listing_id":5374067,"reviewee_id":6986975,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Shanti","has_profile_pic":true,"id":7616206,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/8968bc31-d6ee-4ce0-9bb3-7adf376ada96.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/8968bc31-d6ee-4ce0-9bb3-7adf376ada96.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":7616206,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":5374067,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.35569362591584,"lng":4.908114778833086,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/67105268/1ad0a092_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Spacious Boat with Sunny Terrace","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/67105268/1ad0a092_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":203,"price_formatted":"$209","price_native":209,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/67105268/1ad0a092_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Erik","has_profile_pic":true,"id":6986975,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/6986975/profile_pic/1371592782/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/6986975/profile_pic/1371592782/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":6986975,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/67105268/1ad0a092_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Erik","has_profile_pic":true,"id":6986975,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/6986975/profile_pic/1371592782/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/6986975/profile_pic/1371592782/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Gelders College, Conservatory Utrecht, University of Amsterdam, Royal Conservatory the Hague","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"Pianist, Lawyer"}
