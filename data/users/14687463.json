Robbert was already in the apartment to receive us. To be honest, it was a homely feeling, and we didn't feel like leaving after 3 days. \nThe apartment was very neat and tidy, and the ambience was also beautiful. The location is perfect, and we preferred to walk down the street to the city centre. Metro station is 10 mins walk, which enabled us to explore other parts of the city.\nThanks Meike and Robbert for your earnest efforts. \n\nI strongly recommend her place for making your stay memorable in Amsterdam.","created_at":"2016-06-20T11:16:15Z","id":80966991,"listing_id":3817247,"reviewee_id":14687463,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Anupam","has_profile_pic":true,"id":75632582,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/214cbb98-f6b8-4d69-a3a8-3a5077d0e873.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/214cbb98-f6b8-4d69-a3a8-3a5077d0e873.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":75632582,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":3817247,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.36399313825518,"lng":4.907800464691689,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/48408071/1abecbce_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Cosy apartment in Centre Amsterdam","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/48408071/1abecbce_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":122,"price_formatted":"$126","price_native":126,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/48408071/1abecbce_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Meike","has_profile_pic":true,"id":14687463,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/14687463/profile_pic/1398374474/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/14687463/profile_pic/1398374474/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":14687463,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/48408071/1abecbce_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Meike","has_profile_pic":true,"id":14687463,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/14687463/profile_pic/1398374474/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/14687463/profile_pic/1398374474/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":3,"work":""}
