And 15 minutes to the dam square.\n2) Its in a queite nighberhood\n3) The appartment is realy good for 2 people.\n4) Katja left us some eggs cheese and vegtables and even a bottle of wine.\n\nB-U-T\n\nThere were some problems.\n\n1) At this appartment is written that smoking is aloud, but the only problem was that 1 day before we arrived we got a message from Katja that smoking is aloud only in the balcony, and the blakony is very very very small.. To a 1 person its very diffcult to get in and sit there.\n\n2) Allmost all dishes were dirty! We needed to wash the dishes before we ate..\n\n3) The stove does problems.. It works but suddenly it can start sparking and you need to go the electrical cabinet and turn off the switch and then on again.. This is very dangerous and can make a fire in the appartment. We switched off the switch and lighted the stove with a lighter..","created_at":"2016-05-31T09:44:31Z","id":77312591,"listing_id":1620658,"reviewee_id":5004150,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Tal","has_profile_pic":true,"id":20844206,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/20844206/profile_pic/1409666650/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/20844206/profile_pic/1409666650/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":20844206,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":1620658,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.350654164591475,"lng":4.913489630497977,"medium_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/24366994/39e5998e_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Studio at Amstel","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/24366994/39e5998e_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":111,"price_formatted":"$114","price_native":114,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/24366994/39e5998e_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Katja","has_profile_pic":true,"id":5004150,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5004150/profile_pic/1380032219/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5004150/profile_pic/1380032219/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":5004150,"xl_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/24366994/39e5998e_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Katja","has_profile_pic":true,"id":5004150,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5004150/profile_pic/1380032219/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5004150/profile_pic/1380032219/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"University of Amsterdam","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"Bussia, Hutspot"}
