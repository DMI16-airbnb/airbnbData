My husband is a chemist. We have 4 children from our previous marriages, in the age of 8, 9, 11 and 12 We love traveling, cooking, the beach and each other. My husband just bought a big houseboat not far from our centre apartment, and we divide our time living on the houseboat, and in the centre apartment. We also spend weekends in our small house right on the beach of IJmuiden, half an hour from Amsterdam. We rent out our centre apt but not very often.","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["Dansk","Deutsch","English","Español","Français","Nederlands"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"The apartment and Clea where perfect.
