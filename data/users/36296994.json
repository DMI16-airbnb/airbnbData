For the last 5 years I've had the luck of living in this cosy apartment, right in the middle of everything!\r\n\r\nBecause I love traveling as much as you do and because I really like to meet people from all over the world, it will be great to share with you and offer you my hospitality and knowledge of the city and surroundings.\r\n\r\nI really like cooking and baking and good food, so you can ask me about a wide variety of restaurants and cafe's. If the time is right, who knows, maybe we will even share a meal and a glass of wine or go on a stroll in Amsterdam!\r\n\r\nThere is so much to do and see in Amsterdam to keep you entertained. But!: The Netherlands has so much more to offer than just Amsterdam; so if you enjoy cycling, kayaking or hiking in nature, visit a museum or cultural event or whatever rows your boat, you are most welcome to ask me about what do see and do in the rest of our little country and how to get there.\r\nIt will be my pleasure to share everything I know!\r\n\r\nHopefully I will be able to welcome you soon.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n \r\n","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["Deutsch","English","Fran√ßais","Nederlands","Polski"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":null,"school":"Open Universiteit Nederland","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"Rickshaw driver, manager of rickshaw company"}
