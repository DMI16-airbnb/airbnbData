Franz is a social researcher working in gender equality and women’s rights issues in international development. \r\n\r\nWe consider ourselves socially conscious and appreciate honest food and being with socially aware and engaged people. We love our dog, happy to share her but also understand others may prefer a stay without Leica; so happy to give her a vacation as needed.
