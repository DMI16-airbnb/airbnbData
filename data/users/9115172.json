This sweet apartment is my first house I bought. I realllllly love my place because of the excellent atmosphere. Furthermore it is in the absolute city center of Amsterdam, only 300m walk to the Dam and ca. 10 minutes walk to Amsterdam Central Station. \r\n\r\nI work in a retail company in which I am doing all HR-processes with my team. I love to have drinks with friends and, like all airbnb'ers, travelling the world!\r\n\r\n","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":[],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"The location is great and convenient!\nFleur is a very nice host and always care about us.
