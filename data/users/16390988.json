A nice place from where you can  explore the city. It is not far from the center of Amsterdam and there is always public transport nearby. The owners of the house are open and friendly people. They have traveled a lot and know how nice a warm welcome in a foreign country can be.\r\nThe apartment feels cozy and comfortable. The living room is light and colorful. A nice room where you can feel at home. And if you need a moment for yourself, you can spent some time in the working room beside the living.  \r\nThe bedroom has a lot of space but also welcomes you to feel romantic. The modern chandelier above the master bed, spreads a friendly and soft light.\r\nIn the kitchen you find a big cooling freezer and all you need to cook your favorite diner. There also is a washing/drying machine.\r\nI can highly recommend a stay in this house.  \r\n","relationship_type":"friend","relationship_type_text":"Friend","user_id":16390988}},"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"This is my first airbnb experience and I just LOVE it! Thanks to Stefan and Amber, their home does make me feel like home and it's another highlight of my trip in Amsterdam! The apartment is well-located and it's very easy for me to walk around and visit this city. Besides, the apartment looks exactly like the photos and the bed is extremely comfortable! Stefan is a very responsive and thoughtful host, he always responses in a short period of time and prepares a detailed map and guide for me! If I have a chance to come back, I will definitely go to Stefan & Amber's again!
