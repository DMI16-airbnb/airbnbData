Elmer (24) works as a accountant and Thijmen (22) studies HRM. \r\nOur mother always told us: sharing is caring so we decided to share our home with the visitors of Amsterdam. \r\n\r\nWe are putting our home on airbnb because we want to share the authentic experience of living on a housebout with travelers from all across the world.  We ourselves have travelled across to globe to numerous destinations and our favourite places to stay were not the big hotels but rather something homely. We cherished the opportunity to stay at locations that were similar as to how the local population lived. From Australia to Cuba nothing beats escaping the hordes of tourists and mingling with the locals. And that is exactly what we provide here on our houseboat. \r\n\r\n","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":[],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Very cool place in South Amsterdam.
