He has a nice job and I work in theatre for which both of us often travel. Besides work we love weekends away, going to the mountains and getting to know new places in  non touristy way. Therefore we like to rent our apartment for other people who are looking for a real house (instead of a shitty Amsterdam hotel) to stay and enjoy our beautiful city! We are happy to help them to find their way around so they'll experience Amsterdam in their own personal way.","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":[],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"We arrived tired and hot - our host was on-time to meet us, friendly, and helpful. She was happy to answer any questions; at the same time we did not feel rushed or hovered-over. The apartment was exactly as described, clean, bright and happy, and in a perfect location to all of the major areas and attractions that visitors would want to walk through/view/do. We had a fantastic stay and cannot thank Liliane enough for her hospitality and kindness!","created_at":"2016-05-16T02:11:45Z","id":74480959,"listing_id":3822857,"reviewee_id":19271441,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Shane","has_profile_pic":true,"id":34721018,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/34721018/profile_pic/1433158518/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/34721018/profile_pic/1433158518/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":34721018,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":3822857,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.357177501832375,"lng":4.908668011130917,"medium_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48091726/70b6ffaf_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Sunny appartment","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48091726/70b6ffaf_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":167,"price_formatted":"$172","price_native":172,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48091726/70b6ffaf_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Liliane","has_profile_pic":true,"id":19271441,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/19271441/profile_pic/1407489556/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/19271441/profile_pic/1407489556/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":19271441,"xl_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48091726/70b6ffaf_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Liliane","has_profile_pic":true,"id":19271441,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/19271441/profile_pic/1407489556/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/19271441/profile_pic/1407489556/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Het Rijnlands Lyceum, University of Amsterdam, ACTT - Actors College of Theatre & Television, Universiteit van Amsterdam, Toneelacademie Maastricht, Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten / Amsterdam School of the Arts","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":2,"work":"theatre "}
