The place was clean, well-equipped and situated in a quiet neighbourhood about 15-20min walk from the centrum. There were nice restaurants nearby, and especially a very nice breakfast place (De Ysbreeker). Donna organized us a driver from the airport and was very helpful even though we never met face-to-face. I definately recommend this place for anyone visiting Amsterdam!","created_at":"2016-05-30T00:57:37Z","id":76795361,"listing_id":6917421,"reviewee_id":36255164,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Sara","has_profile_pic":true,"id":7831661,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/0ce86efb-8193-4706-934a-ae75e08f2392.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/0ce86efb-8193-4706-934a-ae75e08f2392.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":7831661,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":6917421,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.35445957135459,"lng":4.908906784576301,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/87607751/4e537bd8_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"River view loft Amsterdam","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/87607751/4e537bd8_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":223,"price_formatted":"$230","price_native":230,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/87607751/4e537bd8_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Donna","has_profile_pic":true,"id":36255164,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/36255164/profile_pic/1435009215/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/36255164/profile_pic/1435009215/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":36255164,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/87607751/4e537bd8_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Donna","has_profile_pic":true,"id":36255164,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/36255164/profile_pic/1435009215/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/36255164/profile_pic/1435009215/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
