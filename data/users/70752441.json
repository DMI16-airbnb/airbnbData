The apartment is located on a quiet, tree lined street overlooking one of the many canals.  The big windows in the living room offer lots of bright light.  Rudolf welcomed us as we arrived, kindly had some beverages and snacks available to us, and was available throughout our trip with any questions we had.  Our kids also appreciated being able to watch a movie and some shows on the Netflix offered in the apartment.
