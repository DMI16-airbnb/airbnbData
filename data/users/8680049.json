Let me introduce myself to you. My name is Anne (32) and I'm a professional travel blogger. I run the largest city blog in Amsterdam called Your(URL HIDDEN) and urban travel channel (URL HIDDEN) For my job I travel all over the world. That's why you can rent my home from time to time. I live together with my love in the upcoming neighbourhood Amsterdam East close to the Amstel river, the city center and the lovely De Pijp district. My home is a mix of design, vintage and souvenirs from all over the world. When you stay at my home I love to help you discover Amsterdam by creating an itinerary especially for you! \r\nSee you in Amsterdam!\r\nAnne","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":[],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Great apartment in a nice neighborhood outside the city center!
