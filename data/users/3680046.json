It is located in up and coming east side of Amsterdam with many nice restaurant near by. Oosterpark is only 5 mins walk from the apartment. If you want to do some light cooking there is a very nice deli across the street with friendly staff. Jan Willem is a fantastic host himself. We maintain good communication during my visit in Amsterdam and he is always very quick with response and provide helpful suggestion and solution. I highly recommend his place!!!!!!
