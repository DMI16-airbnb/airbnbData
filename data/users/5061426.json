She went out of her way to provide suggestions for nice places to eat or buy groceries, and even provided us with some nice foods in our arrival.  The top floor was nice and quiet and we slept very well.  We were a 5-10 minute walk or bike ride from the busier parts of town, and only 2 blocks from the metro, and on a nice canal.  If you don't do well with Amsterdam's very steep, narrow old staircases, just be aware that you'll need to bring your luggage up 4 flights of these on arrival, but for us it was worth it to have the quiet and nice views at the top.","created_at":"2016-06-12T02:51:08Z","id":79191004,"listing_id":3722931,"reviewee_id":5061426,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Celeste","has_profile_pic":true,"id":4448851,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/4448851/profile_pic/1355986336/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/4448851/profile_pic/1355986336/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":4448851,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":3722931,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.36357440990055,"lng":4.90851579106249,"medium_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/74437177/ce71318b_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Cute urban attic loft  Canal view!","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/74437177/ce71318b_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":144,"price_formatted":"$148","price_native":148,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/74437177/ce71318b_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Martine","has_profile_pic":true,"id":5061426,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/09dda4fd-7566-4dfc-92c3-645ae401e3be.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/09dda4fd-7566-4dfc-92c3-645ae401e3be.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":5061426,"xl_picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/74437177/ce71318b_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Martine","has_profile_pic":true,"id":5061426,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/09dda4fd-7566-4dfc-92c3-645ae401e3be.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/09dda4fd-7566-4dfc-92c3-645ae401e3be.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Hogeschool voor de Kunsten Utrecht","signup_method":1,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"hollandse meesters, Festival Hongerige Wolf, Lekkere Dingen"}
