The apartment is really beautiful and cosy, open plan space with plenty of natural light. The communication with Tirza was clear and straightforward, even though we did not meet face to face, we kept in touch during our whole stay. She gave us good tips on what was on for the weekend. The check-in and check-out processes were easy and clear. The location was really good, we could see the Amstel river and watch the rowers every morning, tram and night bus stop that connected us very quickly to the city centre. The neighbourhood is vibrant, supermarkets and plenty of options to eat and drink.\nWe loved the city, and we are definitely going to look for her apartment when we return to Amsterdam.","created_at":"2016-06-21T00:09:38Z","id":80986512,"listing_id":4341765,"reviewee_id":22540576,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Dezyrre","has_profile_pic":true,"id":14658052,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/14658052/profile_pic/1427842844/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/14658052/profile_pic/1427842844/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":14658052,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":4341765,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.352833338051106,"lng":4.907929044840035,"medium_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/56197465/1073ddbd_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Romantic stay, Amstel canal view :)","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/56197465/1073ddbd_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":99,"price_formatted":"$102","price_native":102,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/56197465/1073ddbd_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Tirza","has_profile_pic":true,"id":22540576,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/22540576/profile_pic/1413320181/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/22540576/profile_pic/1413320181/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":22540576,"xl_picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/56197465/1073ddbd_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Tirza","has_profile_pic":true,"id":22540576,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/22540576/profile_pic/1413320181/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/22540576/profile_pic/1413320181/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Hervormd Lyceum Zuid, UvA Amsterdam","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":2,"work":""}
