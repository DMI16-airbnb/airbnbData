The city and the party scene are extremely vibrant, but at the same time offers you plenty of opportunity to relax and just take in the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nAirBnB has been a great platform for me and I am extremely proud that the AirBnB community has rewarded my effort with the Super host status!\r\n\r\n","friends_count":5,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["English","Espa√±ol","Nederlands"],"listings_count":5,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":{"recommendation":{"created_at":"2016-04-12T08:27:26Z","id":575382,"left_by_user":{"user":{"first_name":"Dario","has_profile_pic":true,"id":2605970,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/f34f949a-7401-4401-ae00-6dbde9cd3964.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/f34f949a-7401-4401-ae00-6dbde9cd3964.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","acceptance_rate":"100%","created_at":"2012-06-11T17:19:59Z","identity_verified":true,"is_superhost":false,"picture_large_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/f34f949a-7401-4401-ae00-6dbde9cd3964.jpg?aki_policy=profile_large","recommendation_count":6,"response_rate":"100%","response_time":"within an hour","reviewee_count":277,"thumbnail_medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/f34f949a-7401-4401-ae00-6dbde9cd3964.jpg?aki_policy=profile_medium"}},"recommendation":"Manuel is really involved in hosting and very well organized.
