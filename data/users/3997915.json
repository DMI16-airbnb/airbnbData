I've been living in Amsterdam for about 8 years and recently also 2 years in Curacao (Dutch Caribbean). As of the summer of 2012 I moved back to this lovely city. I studied at a University in Holland and I am currently working in the financial sector. I love sports and travelling, most recently a lot of places in Latin America. I absolutely love Amsterdam and I hope that by sharing my home you will too!","friends_count":1,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["Deutsch","English","Nederlands"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":{"recommendation":{"created_at":"2012-10-29T18:29:47Z","id":122077,"left_by_user":{"user":{"first_name":"Agnes","has_profile_pic":true,"id":426570,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/426570/profile_pic/1299458283/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/426570/profile_pic/1299458283/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","acceptance_rate":"N/A","created_at":"2011-03-07T00:04:54Z","identity_verified":false,"is_superhost":false,"picture_large_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/426570/profile_pic/1299458283/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_large","recommendation_count":0,"response_rate":"N/A","response_time":"N/A","reviewee_count":3,"thumbnail_medium_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/426570/profile_pic/1299458283/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_medium"}},"recommendation":"Great people, great place!

Close to the city centre (but far enough from the horrible touristy areas), nice, quiet and beautiful neighborhood in Amsterdam with public transport right at your door. The house was super clean, very comfortable and spacious. Erik was the greatest host ever, he is a very sweet and accommodating person, and he bought us a round of drinks at the pub we picked up the keys! Our overall experience was perfect, we will definitely stay here again when we go back to Amsterdam. Highly recommended!
