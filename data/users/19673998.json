My name is Joris and I live in a bright apartment at the Amstel river. I'm a professional athlete and because of that I'm traveling a lot, which means my bedroom and the second bedroom are unused most of the year. So sometimes I open apartment to friendly airbnb'ers!\r\n\r\nI will be there to welcome you and tell you where to rent bikes around the corner, get the best lunches and cakes, which museums to check out or skip and maybe where to go for a drink.\r\n\r\nHope this gives you a picture of me and my castle in Amsterdam!","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["Deutsch","English","Nederlands"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Joris was a great host. He waited for me patiently to arrive, despite the fact that I was 20 minutes late. Once I arrived, he greeted me with enthusiasm and made sure I was comfortably settled in, knew my way around the apartment, and had everything I needed. We had a nice casual conversation, during which he gave me very good advice based on my traveling goals. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, I felt like I was not intruding. Rather, I felt like a friend staying over for a weekend in Holland.
