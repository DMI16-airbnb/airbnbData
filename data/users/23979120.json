She picked us up from the train station and brought back. She always took care of our comfort, gave us all the necessary information. It was very nice to meet her!\r\nThe apartment is perfect! It is large, ideally clean, very stylish, fully equipped, modern furniture, comfortable beds, lovely terrace. The apartment is full of features and compliments, there were fresh flowers, breakfast products, perfect wine. The annex is wonderful, very comfortable, it is actually larger than it looks at the picture. \r\nWe spent a wonderful 10 days in the apartment and felt at home all the time. Many thanks to Marion!\r\nIt is the great value for money. I would highly recommend this apartment.\r\n","created_at":"2016-06-02T02:59:29Z","id":77560418,"listing_id":11403250,"reviewee_id":23979120,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Svetlana","has_profile_pic":true,"id":26571281,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/26571281/profile_pic/1422435876/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/26571281/profile_pic/1422435876/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":26571281,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":11403250,"instant_bookable":true,"lat":52.34510127351089,"lng":4.912086694654557,"medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/45b98393-7c94-4d71-adef-4df9b25c6927.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Apartment + Annex near the Amstel.","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/45b98393-7c94-4d71-adef-4df9b25c6927.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":122,"price_formatted":"$126","price_native":126,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/45b98393-7c94-4d71-adef-4df9b25c6927.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Marion","has_profile_pic":true,"id":23979120,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d0bc18d4-6e05-4898-a1ca-2d56c6293ae6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d0bc18d4-6e05-4898-a1ca-2d56c6293ae6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":23979120,"xl_picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/45b98393-7c94-4d71-adef-4df9b25c6927.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Marion","has_profile_pic":true,"id":23979120,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d0bc18d4-6e05-4898-a1ca-2d56c6293ae6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/d0bc18d4-6e05-4898-a1ca-2d56c6293ae6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":2,"work":""}
