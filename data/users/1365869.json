Maybe an intellectual bohémienne! Full of adventure, born in Amsterdam, there after moved 21 times ,Paris, New York, Danmark etc. but  Amsterdam will always be my favourite!. I am interpreter at court in French and Danish, and free lance violin player in several orchestra's, chamber music is my favourite.  I have 2 adorabal kids and 7 grand childs!  With our dog, a very enjoyable sweet little bastard, we are THE  happy family ! In 1992 I build the very first floating hotel in Amsterdam \"La Casalo\"which was known world wide because  is was so personal and so different. Only 4 rooms which made it possible to have a deeper contact with the guests. That such a small hotel would attract celebrities looking for privacy  was a happy suprise to me. I had a lot of fun with those  very special guests, artists, business men, we all had a wonderful time. In 1998 I sold La Casalo, it was a hard decision, but I needed my freedom back! And ..I got it and enjoy every minute of life, making music , fooling around with my small grand childs , sailing and our holidays in Bretagne,You may know that my \"luxe\" is nature and love , for me Luxe has nothing to do with money or glamour. I prefer staying in a little chalet or a mobilhome than in a big hotel with Jaccuzzi! Nature around my boat is something special in the middle of city life. Once I was a farmer - in Denmark - and i know that we will move to the country as soon as we found the wright place. i can not wait.\r\n\r\n","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["Dansk","English","Français","Nederlands"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Wow! What a great way to visit Amsterdam. Instead of taking a hotel or a \"regular\" appartment like in every place in the world we took Pauline's houseboat which is breathtaking. To live on the water with this amazing terrace is the most relaxing plce I've seen. We've been there every minute we had.\r\n","created_at":"2016-06-13T00:12:57Z","id":79300586,"listing_id":260302,"reviewee_id":1365869,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Roy","has_profile_pic":true,"id":6331725,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/6331725/profile_pic/1368272381/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/6331725/profile_pic/1368272381/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":6331725,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":260302,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.35219808493511,"lng":4.9100400327232885,"medium_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/2549634/0cd3dadc_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Houseboat Amsterdam C 4 pers entire boat for you.","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/2549634/0cd3dadc_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":221,"price_formatted":"$228","price_native":228,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/2549634/0cd3dadc_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Pauline","has_profile_pic":true,"id":1365869,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/1365869/profile_pic/1320404781/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/1365869/profile_pic/1320404781/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":1365869,"xl_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/2549634/0cd3dadc_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Pauline","has_profile_pic":true,"id":1365869,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/1365869/profile_pic/1320404781/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/1365869/profile_pic/1320404781/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Edith Stein Lyceum Den Haag","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"Juridisch tolk aan de Rechtbank, Hotelliere,  Freelance violiste"}
