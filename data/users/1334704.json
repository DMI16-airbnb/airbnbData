Claudia is a fabulous host and just a great person - easy to communicate with and she made sure we had everything we needed during our stay - breakfast, extra firewood, fresh towels, etc.  We stayed in the upstairs unit which was very well designed and maintained and clean.  We loved the little fireplace and espresso machine.  The bed was very comfortable. The steam shower was terrific and the regular shower had nice hot water and good water pressure.  The location is great, a short 15 minute walk to the center of town and many places nearby to rent bicycles.  Overall we loved our stay and would DEFINITELY stay here again!
