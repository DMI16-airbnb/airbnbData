Also close enough to walk into Amsterdam central or a short tram ride. The apartment is well furnished with everything you need for your stay, good taste, lovely decoration, and the two cats are very independent  friendly. Femke offers us and provided helpful information about the city . Communication was good and the flexibility with check-in and checkout times was extremely convenient - thanks!
