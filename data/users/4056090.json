Preferably by spending time with locals and visiting markets. Cooking and eating together and finding new treasures. We are very lucky to be able do do just that while abroad for work 3 months of the year for the Dutch, Danish and Norwegian Survivor TV-shows.\r\n\r\nWe currently live on the lovely northern past of Amsterdam with our dog Spook who loves to run around in the park across the street. Our house in the city center is completely adapted for the comfort of our guests and more permanently rented out via Airbnb. We take great pride in taking care of the houses and fill them with all the things we love. One of us or our friend (who lives around the corner) will be there to welcome you and show you the house, and naturally you can contact us with whatever question you may have.\r\n\r\n","friends_count":1,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["Deutsch","English","Español","Français","Nederlands"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":{"recommendation":{"created_at":"2012-12-23T10:56:44Z","id":134668,"left_by_user":{"user":{"first_name":"Vasilis","has_profile_pic":true,"id":4472338,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/4472338/profile_pic/1356342432/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/4472338/profile_pic/1356342432/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","acceptance_rate":"N/A","created_at":"2012-12-23T10:10:10Z","identity_verified":false,"is_superhost":false,"picture_large_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/4472338/profile_pic/1356342432/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_large","recommendation_count":0,"response_rate":"N/A","response_time":"N/A","reviewee_count":0,"thumbnail_medium_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/4472338/profile_pic/1356342432/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_medium"}},"recommendation":"The apartment is really nice and cozy,functional  and in an excellent typical location in the heart of Amsterdam. \r\nYou can just be in Dam square just in 5 minutes on foot.\r\nUnbeatable neighborhood with the one of the oldest cathedral with many restaurants bars and cafe and one of the biggest markets in Amsterdam (Wateloonplein). \r\nIts so comfortable apartment with wooden floors , very warm, a great bed and more than a great bathroom....do not miss it! \r\nCause its so difficult in Amsterdam to find a house with  a big and seamless bathroom! and of course do not miss the jacuzzi!\r\nKitchen well equipped in order to cook your own meals.\r\nJeroen is a great , caring , helpful and he is doing everything to make you feel like as it is your home!\r\nI would recommend this to everyone.Will definitely go back to this homely place.","relationship_type":"travel_buddy","relationship_type_text":"Travel Buddy","user_id":4056090}},"recent_review":null,"school":"Maartens College, HBO werktuigbouwkunde Groningen","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":2,"work":"Own boss, woodworker, stagebuilding, TV and film, construction,  furnitures, design"}
