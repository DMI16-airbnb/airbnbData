I have also started an MBA. It's very challenging, but very rewarding as well! I have lived in many places in the world, including the United States (in Aspen, Colorado), Sweden and Australia. My grandfather lived on a canal here in Amsterdam and it was always my dream to do the same thing. Five years ago the dream became reality when I found this great apartment. I love living here every single day of the year. I travel frequently for business and studies, which is why I am happy to rent out my apartment. It's a beautiful place to experience living like true Amsterdam locals!
