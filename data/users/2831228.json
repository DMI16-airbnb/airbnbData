Our apartment is very suitable (and only available) for families. The house has two childrens rooms, one for our 4 year old, which has a small childrens bed. The other childrens room has a high bed (we have a 7 year old) and also a bed underneath. Just check if you think that will fit. If needed someone can sleep on the sofa in the living room. \r\nwe are really close the station and subway so that will serve you fine. \r\n\r\nif you are all ok, then i will accept you request and then it is booked!\r\n\r\nregards veronique","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["Deutsch","English","Nederlands"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"A lovely Apartment, it was a pleasure to stay there, very bright and quiet, just perfect for a family, very well located in the heart of Amsterdam, everything in a walking distance.
