Even better if you have a bike, then everything is in reach simply. All the arrangements and contact were straight-forward. The house itself is fine for a short stay, although the kitchen and bathroom are very basic. Maaike very kindly left some food on the fridge and a good stock of coffee and other small items which was appreciated.","created_at":"2016-06-30T05:33:25Z","id":82874818,"listing_id":6830226,"reviewee_id":35781271,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Steven","has_profile_pic":true,"id":8487246,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/8487246/profile_pic/1377855513/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/8487246/profile_pic/1377855513/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":8487246,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":6830226,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.3522612934767,"lng":4.911301686944687,"medium_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/86377411/a3b29cf3_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Close to the Amstel, pleasant house","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/86377411/a3b29cf3_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":83,"price_formatted":"$85","price_native":85,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/86377411/a3b29cf3_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Maaike","has_profile_pic":true,"id":35781271,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/35781271/profile_pic/1434301411/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/35781271/profile_pic/1434301411/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":35781271,"xl_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/86377411/a3b29cf3_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Maaike","has_profile_pic":true,"id":35781271,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/35781271/profile_pic/1434301411/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/35781271/profile_pic/1434301411/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"","signup_method":0,"total_listings_count":1,"work":""}
