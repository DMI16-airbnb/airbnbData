With her amazing people skills, and a keen eye for detail, she makes an amazing AirBNB host. She is warm, friendly, and inviting, and takes true pleasure in making sure that her guests are comfortable. I have stayed at her place several times, and left feeling very relaxed. Not only is her apartment amazingly located in one of the best areas in Amsterdam, but it has a canal view, and is one of the cleanest rooms I have ever slept in. I would highly recommend trusting Mitzy with your next stay!","relationship_type":"friend","relationship_type_text":"Friend","user_id":1428095}},"recent_review":null,"school":"Dawson College, Concordia University, McGill University","signup_method":1,"total_listings_count":9,"work":""}
