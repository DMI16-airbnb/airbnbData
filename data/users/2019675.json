He was friendly and accommodating. Apartment is outside city and in a quiet neighborhood of Amsterdam. Nice, simple room and can walk to city center in 15-20 minutes. Chandan was incredibly kind and let us leave our bags there the entire next day until 8 pm. No complaints. Best for a short stay due to limited kitchen area.
