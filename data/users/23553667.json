The check in was 1pm, but when we arrived at 2, the cleaner was there and not finished until 3:30.  He did a quick clean, so it was not very clean.  The description is misleading: 2nd 'bedroom' is about 7x8 ft, barely big enough for the bed and to just walk around it.  No room for cases, etc.  There is NO bathroom (!), although it says 1 bathroom, there is only a toilet, but the shower and basin are in one of the bedrooms, a very unsatisfactory arrangement for 2 couples.  there were no towel hangers so we had to drape wet towels over chairs.  this is not a 4 person flat, maybe for a couple and 2 small children but not for 4 adults.
