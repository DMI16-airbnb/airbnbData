I'm Anne. I'm from a small town called Weesp which lies close to Amsterdam. Like living, especially cycling ;-) in Amsterdam. Enjoy drinking tea or wine at one of the benches near the Amstel. Love being in my charming apartment. If you have time and would like to visit an old windmill (inside), I recommend to visite the windmill across my family home in Weesp. Of course I can show you how to get there.
