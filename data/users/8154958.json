The view from both kitchen and living areas, of the quiet canal, and the Hermitage museum buildings on the other side of the canal, is a wonderful thing to wake up to, and return home to after a day of sightseeing. \nI can highly recommend Heleen's apartment for anyone visiting Amsterdam and consider it one of the highlights of our time travelling in Europe.
