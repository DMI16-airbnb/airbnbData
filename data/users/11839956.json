Sophia owns the apartment but she is traveling in Australia so Daphne is responsible for welcoming the guests!\r\n\r\nSophia: I am a Dutch girl living in and loving Amsterdam. My parents have a small boutique hotel in Greece called Villa Ippocampi, where I grew up and got used to welcoming guests. I finished the Hotel Management School in Maastricht and i am specialized in creating and developing new Food & Beverage Concepts. Sometimes i am an assistant of an interior stylist and a photographer during photo shoots.\r\nI like my apartment neat, clean and cozy. It's great living on the canal and watching the boats pass by while eating or reading a book.\r\n\r\nDaphne: I am a medical student who wants to become a neurologist. I live very close by my sisters apartment, so if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask!\r\n","friends_count":0,"identity_v2_verified":false,"is_generated_user":false,"languages":["English","Nederlands","Ελληνικά"],"listings_count":1,"location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","recent_recommendation":null,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"If you want a beautiful staying in Amsterdam… I couldn’t think of a better option to suggest.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is cozy, lovely decorated and plenty of little good taste details…you feel like home… or even better as the views are amazing, a quiet canal just in front of it, you could stay there for hours watching the ducks swimming, the little boats passing by… so peaceful! \r\n\r\nThe apartment is even nicer than in the pictures. And the energy is so harmonious… Stylish place with everything you need for a perfect stay (we stayed for a week), really close to a metro station (2 min.) and walking just in 12 min. you are in the center, although you’ll stay in a really quiet place all the time. Sometimes I felt lazy to around Amsterdam as I felt so good there! \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is classy and close to the Amsterdam University, you find lovely and animated cafes, restaurants, parks and terraces around… I highly recommend walking around the place to discover the surroundings… surprising! And you can bet if you follow Sophia’s and Daphne’s suggestions, in the papers they left for you, you find when you get there, you are going to have a great experience in Amsterdam. We did ☺ \r\n\r\nCommunication with Daphne (even being ill these days) was quick and helpful in so many ways! She helped us to have a really nice Amsterdam staying with great suggestions and info about activities etc… She is really kind and educated and you feel like having a friend there to support you.\r\n\r\nMy first experience in Airbnb (or any other rent apartment) and I can’t be happier.\r\nSurely it couldn’t have been this way in a hotel or other place.\r\n\r\nBeyond recommendable. \r\n","created_at":"2016-05-08T00:38:54Z","id":73137408,"listing_id":3068507,"reviewee_id":11839956,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"David","has_profile_pic":true,"id":67531497,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/f1629446-475d-445a-a1b6-2d961eaa4a94.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/f1629446-475d-445a-a1b6-2d961eaa4a94.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":67531497,"role":"guest","listing":{"listing":{"city":"Amsterdam","collection_ids":null,"country":"Netherlands","has_double_blind_reviews":false,"id":3068507,"instant_bookable":false,"lat":52.36304116343269,"lng":4.909077791135895,"medium_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/43572496/3254ae11_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium","name":"Stylish apartment on the canal!","native_currency":"USD","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/43572496/3254ae11_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","price":144,"price_formatted":"$148","price_native":148,"smart_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/43572496/3254ae11_original.jpg?aki_policy=small","user":{"user":{"first_name":"Sophia En Daphne","has_profile_pic":true,"id":11839956,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/11839956/profile_pic/1430046753/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/11839956/profile_pic/1430046753/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"user_id":11839956,"xl_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/43572496/3254ae11_original.jpg?aki_policy=x_large"}},"reviewee":{"user":{"first_name":"Sophia En Daphne","has_profile_pic":true,"id":11839956,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/11839956/profile_pic/1430046753/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/11839956/profile_pic/1430046753/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}}}},"school":"Hotel Management School Maastricht, Hoge Hotelschool Maastricht","signup_method":1,"total_listings_count":1,"work":"Villa Ippocampi, EME Hospitality Projects, HMS amsterdam"}
