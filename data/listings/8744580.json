It’s covering two floors, the 1st and 2nd. Near the quiet waters of Transvaalkade and several typical Amsterdam squares, where people gather and cafés flourish.\n\nThe apartment is just over 100m2, so quite spacious for two. It covers two floors and is part of an apartment complex with a shared stairway leading to the apartments. It has a private terrace next to the apartment, and also two balconies. All of them have sunlight more or less throughout the day/evening.\nThe complex is build during the initial build of the southern part of Transvaalbuurt somewhere during the 1930ties. It has a couple of authentic details like a bay window for instance.\n\nYou can access all rooms. However in the walk-in closet is nothing to find, so walking around is okay, but you can't use anything in there.\n\nI'll be available via telephone or e-mail.\n\nYou can best take a train, tram, bus or underground to the Amstel Station or Wibautstraat Station. It's a short walk from there (aprox. 10min.).\nGetting to the city can be done by bike (you can rent bikes through the whole of Amsterdam). By bike it's about 10 minutes to get to the city centre stuff. Also you can take the underground from Amstel Station or Wibautstraat Station. Both are 5-10 minute walk.\nTaking the bus or tram to any where can be done from Amstel Station or Beukenplein (square).\n\n>> Mind you: our lovely place is in the final stage of a rebuild. We feel it's 99% finished, so very well liveable and enjoyable, however some things are not yet done. I'll outline that in detail further down below.\n- Not all areas have doors\n- Some lighting is yet to be installed, however in all areas is a way to activate a (standing) lamp.","description_locale":"en","experiences_offered":"none","extra_user_info":null,"extras_price_native":40,"guests_included":1,"has_agreed_to_legal_terms":true,"has_license":false,"has_viewed_cleaning":null,"has_viewed_ib_perf_dashboard_panel":null,"has_viewed_terms":true,"house_rules":"We expect you to respect our belongings and not cause disturbance to the neighbours.\nFurther more; no smoking, no pets, no extra guests.","instant_book_welcome_message":null,"interaction":"I'll be available via telephone or e-mail.","is_location_exact":true,"jurisdiction_names":"Amsterdam","jurisdiction_rollout_names":"Amsterdam","language":"en","license":null,"listing_cleaning_fee_native":40,"listing_monthly_price_native":null,"listing_price_for_extra_person_native":0,"listing_security_deposit_native":null,"listing_weekend_price_native":114,"listing_weekly_price_native":420,"locale":"en","map_image_url":"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?maptype=roadmap&markers=52.35254373084715%2C4.919535616932364&size=480x320&zoom=15&client=gme-airbnbinc&channel=monorail-prod&signature=HSk2uiezPj9LA2jD-9NThRWG9Os%3D","max_nights":1125,"max_nights_input_value":1125,"min_nights_input_value":3,"monthly_price_factor":1.0,"monthly_price_native":null,"neighborhood_overview":"","notes":">> Mind you: our lovely place is in the final stage of a rebuild.

The apartment is spacious and beautifully decorated. Upon arrival, the place was throughly clean and stocked with any essentials you may need. Although I did not meet Wouter, my friend and I were greeted with sweet and helpful post-it notes left all around the apartment along with an extensive guide of eateries around the area. I loved the idea of the openness of Wouter's apartment, there are no doors to the rooms upstairs so if you value privacy it may be an issue. There is however a downstairs bathroom which is completely private alongside the kitchen. We slept in a very comfortable bed with the option of having more or less of pillows and blankets to our liking. The key exchange to the apartment also went smoothly as it was left at a nearby cafe. In terms of contact, I was able to easily communicate with both Wouter and his sister for any questions or concerns I may have. We had a wonderful time for our first trip to Amsterdam and staying at Wouter's added to making it a very comfortable and uniquely enjoyable experience.
