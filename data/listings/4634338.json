Although our stay was OK, the photos and description is misleading. It's certainly modern with lots of fancy equipment, is centrally located close to amsterdam centraal if you're looking to make a lot of day trips (which we were), is in a fairly lively neighborhood with a supermarket nearby. However, I wouldn't call the apartment luxurious because the hosts only provided very basic amenities -- for example, you're expected to carry your own hair dryer, buy your own dishwasher detergent, there was just barely enough handwash liquid to last us the 5 days in the apartment, the towels provided weren't soft and in fact there seemed to be stains on one of them. Also the wifi didnt work in the bedroom. The communication with the host was great, they allowed us a slightly earlier check-in but the person letting us in did not warmly receive us --- no smiles, didnt offer to help my 63 year old mother with the bag she was carrying up a very steep staircase with narrow steps. The apartment is the one shown in the photos, but in the photos it's definitely staged with beautiful lighting. We didn't get the same sense of warmth when we walked into the apartment, as depicted in the photos. I also don't think it had been thoroughly cleaned --- the fridge had leftovers from the last renters, I felt the dust beneath my feet walking in the apartment in some areas and the towels and linen from the previous wash were still drying when we came in and were left for us to fold away and put away. I do feel the apartment is overpriced for the amenities provided currently and if the host made just a few adjustments, it would actually be wonderful and good value for money. For me the disappointment stemmed from a mismatch in expectations based on the photos, the description as \"luxurious\" and the warmth and friendliness I've come to expect from AirBnB hosts which I didn't get here.","created_at":"2016-04-25T01:26:02Z","id":71224751,"listing_id":4634338,"reviewee_id":1266717,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Yamini","has_profile_pic":true,"id":4691271,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/4691271/profile_pic/1358118025/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/4691271/profile_pic/1358118025/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":4691271,"role":"guest"}},"toto_opt_in":null,"wireless_info":null,"listing_occupancy_info":{"show_occupancy_message":false},"review_rating_accuracy":9,"review_rating_checkin":10,"review_rating_cleanliness":9,"review_rating_communication":10,"review_rating_location":10,"review_rating_value":9,"is_business_travel_ready":false}}
