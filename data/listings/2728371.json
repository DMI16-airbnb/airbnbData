Located uniquely on the Amstel, the river that gave Amsterdam her name. \n\nLight/central/close to stores & restaurants/safe/quiet/easy access/private\n\nThe ground floor is comprised of a modern kitchen which is fully equipped (dishwasher, oven, microwave, fridge, stove with 4 burners, wash machine, water cooker, coffee machine and blender) and has all the needs for a comfortable stay in the city. There is a big dining table in the open kitchen where you can enjoy breakfast/dinner with a view on the canal.\nThe big dining table is part of the sitting room with a cosy 'see through' gas fire place and a large sofa bed couch (2 grown ups), sliding doors to the outdoor terrace. At the entrance you will find a separate toilet. 4 big windows shed an abundance of light in to the space - which can be prevented by curtains if so desired. And of course makes it possible to enjoy the view. Its spacious but not overwhelmingly large (about 50m2); sun deck/terrace excluded. \n\nOne level down (yes, half under water) one will find a large state of the art bathroom - with a second toilet, bath, rain shower etc., a  laundry room (may be used; washer and dryer), 2 spacious bedrooms (one is the guestroom that we rent out), and 2 smaller rooms currently used for storage. \n\nThe bed in the guestroom is 180 by 210 cm (king seize - 2 separate matrasses with a topper but cannot be divided into 2 beds). You may opt for 2 separate duvet's or choose one romantic big one. \nIf you are with two friends and you would rather not share a bed, then you can use the upstairs sofa couch. Bedding is available, just ask in advance. \n\nHeating is provided through floor heating throughout the house and if you want to add a pinch; use the gas fireplace. \nJust to be clear; (hot) water, gas and electricity are available as if it were a normal house. Also available is wifi through out the house, a sonos hifi system and TV set. \n\nIn total the living space ex terrace is about 120 m2 - but looks a lot smaller from the outside. \n\nDon't worry about motion sickness, the boat might move somewhat due to wind or waves at times but only ever so slightly. 98% of the time you will not notice the house moving at all. \n\nNote that the master bedroom usually is not rented out. Can be discussed, but a subsequent charge will be added.\n\nOwn entrance by gang board - through front door. During your stay you will have the whole premises to yourself, there will be no other guests nor will we be there.\n\nAs we only rent out the space when traveling (mostly for business), the chance we will meet in person is small. However, my neighbours (native English speakers) are very helpful (and key holders) as other potential key holders you might encounter.\nI respond quickly to emails - basically, I'm always online if not sleeping. \n\nAs we do live there, its inevitable that you will find traces of our lives in the boat - although we try to keep that to a bare minimum.\n\nWithin walking distance you can find an abundance of nice local restaurants from (very) posh, to trendy, small & local, or business type venues. Notably, the best vegetarian restaurant in town (Betty's) is a 5 min walk away. \n\nSupermarkets and other shops are also 5 min walk away, all can be found on the Rijnstraat (Albert Heijn being our most well known).\n\nVery conveniently located! \n\nTrain & Metro\nIts a seven minute walk to Amstel train station (train and metro) from where you can travel to central station Amsterdam (10 min), Schiphol (25 min) or Utrecht and beyond (25 min). \n\nTram & bus\nIts a 2 minute walk to buses and trams that will get you to the city center (our better said: the canal ring) in less than 15 minutes. Or just stroll up the Amstel river on a nice day which is a gorgeous walk day or night! (romantic too). The area is very safe, you can walk around at any time day or night without having to worry (not withstanding normal cautious behavior of course). \n\nNote that the 'Rivierenbuurt' - as my neighborhood is called - is still considered to belong the inner area of Amsterdam. Close to the trendy 'Oost' (East) and the 'De Pijp' area. The canal ring ('Jordaan' or 'Centrum') is about 10 to 15 min by public transport. \n\nWe have a cat (and part time children at times). If you are hugely allergic, this might be a problem. Of course we keep the house very tidy and clean. Unless you are great cat lovers (the cat is of course awesome), he will not be there when the boat is rented out.  \n\nThe sounds from the street are hard to hear inside (very isolated), if you open the windows there will be some noise during rush-hours. The bedroom downstairs is quiet. Other than that, you might hear duck like sounds, or rowing boats. \n\nClean and fresh linens will waiting upon arrival \n\nGuests are most welcome to use appliances to cook and ingredients like salt, peper, oil, butter etc. \n\nAny cost of damage or theft between arrival and departure will immediately be recovered\n\nGuests are welcome to the livingroom, kitchen, both bathrooms and their guest room. Of course also to enjoy the outdoor area as much as possible too.\n\nAs its our own house most likely we will be traveling when guests are staying in the houseboat. However, always reachable by phone and with friendly neighbors, so far all has always gone well.\n\nNote that the 'Rivierenbuurt' - as my neighborhood is called - is still considered to belong the inner area of Amsterdam. Close to the trendy 'Oost' (East) and the 'De Pijp' area. The canal ring ('Jordaan' or 'Centrum') is about 10 to 15 min by public transport.\n\nTrain & Metro\nIts a seven minute walk to Amstel train station (train and metro) from where you can travel to central station Amsterdam (10 min), Schiphol (25 min) or Utrecht and beyond (25 min). \n\nTram & bus\nIts a 2 minute walk to buses and trams that will get you to the city center (our better said: the canal ring) in less than 15 minutes. Or just stroll up the Amstel river on a nice day which is a gorgeous walk day or night! (romantic too). The area is very safe, you can walk around at any time day or night without having to worry (not withstanding normal cautious behavior of course). \n\nParking\n* Unfortunately I do not have I private parking spot \n* However, parking is available around the house (ample of space in a radius of 350m) but not free. The rate locally is 2,40 euro per hour from 9am to 9pm, Monday to Saturday. Parking is outside on the street and can fit anything from a mini's to SUV's. \n* Within a 15 min walk you will find a garage which charges 10 euro per day. \nSwitchpark Eenhoorn Amsterdam-Oost - Stephensonstraat (PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN) Amsterdam.\nYou will need to register and book in advance, the place accepts foreign mobile numbers for reservation. \n* In another area, also a 15 min walk away parking costs 0,10 euro for the first 3 hours, after that you pay 2,40 euro per hour till 7pm. Free parking on Saturday and Sunday. Address: Joan Muyskensweg, Amsterdam.\n* Free parking is available at the following address: \nDiemerdreef 1, 1112 CK Diemen, Netherlands\nIn order to get to the boat you need to take the metro at metro stop Diemen-Zuid, hop on metro nr 53 to Central Station (CS) Amsterdam, 4 stops will take you to Amstel Station where you exit. If you take the back exit from Amstel Station and walk towards the water you can see the houseboat on the other side of the water. You just need to walk via the bridge on your right hand (Berlage brug) to get there (7 min). Total trip I estimate is about 30 min max.\n\nonly toilet paper down the toilet - cannot be stressed enough (no wet-ties either!)","description_locale":"en","experiences_offered":"none","extra_user_info":null,"extras_price_native":30,"guests_included":2,"has_agreed_to_legal_terms":true,"has_license":false,"has_viewed_cleaning":null,"has_viewed_ib_perf_dashboard_panel":null,"has_viewed_terms":true,"house_rules":"Treat my house as you would do your own, and I'll be a happy camper.

Please do not throw too much toilet paper inside the toilet or any other things than normal paper. Please Please DON'T EVER DISPOSE OF SANITARY TOWELS or other cotton-based hygienic wipes in our toilets. This will cause the sewage-pump to fail, with very serious consequences indeed.

stunning houseboat (135m2) will offer an experience you will not easily forget. Located uniquely on the Amstel, the river that gave Amsterdam her name. \n\nLight/central/close to stores & restaurants/safe/quiet/easy access/private\n\nThe ground floor is comprised of a modern kitchen which is fully equipped (dishwasher, oven, microwave, fridge, stove with 4 burners, wash machine, water cooker, coffee machine and blender) and has all the needs for a comfortable stay in the city. There is a big dining table in the open kitchen where you can enjoy breakfast/dinner with a view on the canal.\nThe big dining table is part of the sitting room with a cosy 'see through' gas fire place and a large sofa bed couch (2 grown ups), sliding doors to the outdoor terrace. At the entrance you will find a separate toilet. 4 big windows shed an abundance of light in to the space - which can be prevented by curtains if so desired. And of course makes it possible to enjoy the view. Its spacious but not overwhelmingly large (about 50m2); sun deck/terrace excluded. \n\nOne level down (yes, half under water) one will find a large state of the art bathroom - with a second toilet, bath, rain shower etc., a  laundry room (may be used; washer and dryer), 2 spacious bedrooms (one is the guestroom that we rent out), and 2 smaller rooms currently used for storage. \n\nThe bed in the guestroom is 180 by 210 cm (king seize - 2 separate matrasses with a topper but cannot be divided into 2 beds). You may opt for 2 separate duvet's or choose one romantic big one. \nIf you are with two friends and you would rather not share a bed, then you can use the upstairs sofa couch. Bedding is available, just ask in advance. \n\nHeating is provided through floor heating throughout the house and if you want to add a pinch; use the gas fireplace. \nJust to be clear; (hot) water, gas and electricity are available as if it were a normal house. Also available is wifi through out the house, a sonos hifi system and TV set. \n\nIn total the living space ex terrace is about 120 m2 - but looks a lot smaller from the outside. \n\nDon't worry about motion sickness, the boat might move somewhat due to wind or waves at times but only ever so slightly. 98% of the time you will not notice the house moving at all. \n\nNote that the master bedroom usually is not rented out. Can be discussed, but a subsequent charge will be added.\n\nOwn entrance by gang board - through front door. During your stay you will have the whole premises to yourself, there will be no other guests nor will we be there.\n\nAs we only rent out the space when traveling (mostly for business), the chance we will meet in person is small. However, my neighbours (native English speakers) are very helpful (and key holders) as other potential key holders you might encounter.\nI respond quickly to emails - basically, I'm always online if not sleeping. \n\nAs we do live there, its inevitable that you will find traces of our lives in the boat - although we try to keep that to a bare minimum.\n\nWithin walking distance you can find an abundance of nice local restaurants from (very) posh, to trendy, small & local, or business type venues. Notably, the best vegetarian restaurant in town (Betty's) is a 5 min walk away. \n\nSupermarkets and other shops are also 5 min walk away, all can be found on the Rijnstraat (Albert Heijn being our most well known).\n\nVery conveniently located! \n\nTrain & Metro\nIts a seven minute walk to Amstel train station (train and metro) from where you can travel to central station Amsterdam (10 min), Schiphol (25 min) or Utrecht and beyond (25 min). \n\nTram & bus\nIts a 2 minute walk to buses and trams that will get you to the city center (our better said: the canal ring) in less than 15 minutes. Or just stroll up the Amstel river on a nice day which is a gorgeous walk day or night! (romantic too). The area is very safe, you can walk around at any time day or night without having to worry (not withstanding normal cautious behavior of course). \n\nNote that the 'Rivierenbuurt' - as my neighborhood is called - is still considered to belong the inner area of Amsterdam. Close to the trendy 'Oost' (East) and the 'De Pijp' area. The canal ring ('Jordaan' or 'Centrum') is about 10 to 15 min by public transport. \n\nWe have a cat (and part time children at times). If you are hugely allergic, this might be a problem. Of course we keep the house very tidy and clean. Unless you are great cat lovers (the cat is of course awesome), he will not be there when the boat is rented out.  \n\nThe sounds from the street are hard to hear inside (very isolated), if you open the windows there will be some noise during rush-hours. The bedroom downstairs is quiet. Other than that, you might hear duck like sounds, or rowing boats. \n\nClean and fresh linens will waiting upon arrival \n\nGuests are most welcome to use appliances to cook and ingredients like salt, peper, oil, butter etc. \n\nAny cost of damage or theft between arrival and departure will immediately be recovered","square_feet":null,"star_rating":5.0,"summary":"Built late 2014, this stunning houseboat offers the unique Amsterdam experience.

The rate locally is 2,40 euro per hour from 9am to 9pm, Monday to Saturday. Parking is outside on the street and can fit anything from a mini's to SUV's. \n* Within a 15 min walk you will find a garage which charges 10 euro per day. \nSwitchpark Eenhoorn Amsterdam-Oost - Stephensonstraat (PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN) Amsterdam.\nYou will need to register and book in advance, the place accepts foreign mobile numbers for reservation. \n* In another area, also a 15 min walk away parking costs 0,10 euro for the first 3 hours, after that you pay 2,40 euro per hour till 7pm. Free parking on Saturday and Sunday. Address: Joan Muyskensweg, Amsterdam.\n* Free parking is available at the following address: \nDiemerdreef 1, 1112 CK Diemen, Netherlands\nIn order to get to the boat you need to take the metro at metro stop Diemen-Zuid, hop on metro nr 53 to Central Station (CS) Amsterdam, 4 stops will take you to Amstel Station where you exit. If you take the back exit from Amstel Station and walk towards the water you can see the houseboat on the other side of the water. You just need to walk via the bridge on your right hand (Berlage brug) to get there (7 min).

The place is new, that's why I'm only looking to rent to couples (in every formation!), 2 friends,  business visitors, or families with children above 8. \n\n* Non smoking please, but there is a good outside terrace where you can enjoy your cigarette.\n* IMPORTANT: the sewerage system is different on a boat. Please do not throw too much toilet paper inside the toilet or any other things than normal paper. Please Please DON'T EVER DISPOSE OF SANITARY TOWELS or other cotton-based hygienic wipes in our toilets. This will cause the sewage-pump to fail, with very serious consequences indeed. Please also notify other guests / children etc about this very important issue. You can put these items in the hygienic-bin beside the toilet. \n* Don't take any of the inside furniture outside. I have special furniture for outside and please only use these. \n* Close all the windows when you leave the house and be sure to lock the front door properly.\n* Sorry, no dogs (very small ones can be discussed - I do actually like them).","in_building":false,"in_toto_area":false,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Wir hatten die Gelegenheit ein enorm entspanntes Wochenende auf dem wunderschÃ¶nen und gemÃ¼tlichen Hausboot von Nynke und Roderick zu verbringen. \r\n\r\nDie Kommunikation war Ã¼ber die gesamte Zeit hinweg tadellos.
