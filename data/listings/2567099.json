The master bedroom in the middle (12 m2) has a kingsize 'sky' bed. The small one in the front of the house with a view at the canal, is optional and suitable for 1 or 2 little children. \nThe blue tiled bathroom obtains a bath and separate shower.\nThere is a washing room with washing machine and dryer.\nThe living room includes the fully equipped kitchen (dishwasher, oven, microwave) with a dining table. From here you can walk into the garden, situated on the south, so you'll be able to enjoy the sun all day.\n\nYou have access to the whole apartment and garden if you are coming with children. If not, one of the bedrooms will be closed.\n\nYou will have all the privacy you need for your stay.\nIf there is a problem you can reach us by phone or one of our neighbours will be available for help.\n\nThe apartment is located in one of the oldest parts of the historical centre of Amsterdam called the Plantage Weesper-area. It is situated in the north/east center with the Artis Zoo and Wertheim Park & Hortus Botanicus on walking distance. There are also lots of little restaurants, nice coffee shops and a cinema nearby.\n\nThere are parking spots for your car in front of the apartment, but you have to pay for it, so the best thing you can do is travel by public transport and/or rent a bicycle (which is the best way to see amsterdam anyway!)\nIf you don't want to cycle, you can easily take the tram, bus or metro nearby to get around. There's a (subway)station within a 5 minute walk.\n\nThe apartment is suitable for two persons and one or two children.","description_locale":"en","experiences_offered":"none","extra_user_info":null,"extras_price_native":30,"guests_included":2,"has_agreed_to_legal_terms":true,"has_license":false,"has_viewed_cleaning":null,"has_viewed_ib_perf_dashboard_panel":null,"has_viewed_terms":true,"house_rules":"Treat and enjoy the house as it is your own home.
