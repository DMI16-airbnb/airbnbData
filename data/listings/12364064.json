Large bed, small kitchen with everything you need and brand new bathroom.\n\nYou will have the full apartment to yourself\n\nEither i will hand over the keys or one of my neigbours will. I will give you a list of everything you need and i am standby via phone or text all day to answer your questions and give advice about this beautiful city\n\nLocation is near the Amstel which is one of the best places in Amsterdam, Quiet but lively and only 5 minutes by bike towards the centre of Amsterdam. A lot of cheap restaurants nearby, let me know what kind of food you like and i'll prepare a list of the best places in Amsterdam!\n\nMetro is 100 meters away from the apartment which brings you to Schiphol and Amsterdam central station in about 20 min. If you chose to get around Amsterdam as a typical Dutchie there are plenty of bike rentals nearby\n\nIf you come by car you should know that parking in Amsterdam is very expensive, however i know a secured car park only 10 minutes away by metro where you can park the car for 1 euro a day (including free metro card)","description_locale":"en","experiences_offered":"none","extra_user_info":null,"extras_price_native":15,"guests_included":1,"has_agreed_to_legal_terms":true,"has_license":false,"has_viewed_cleaning":null,"has_viewed_ib_perf_dashboard_panel":null,"has_viewed_terms":null,"house_rules":"Apartment is on the third floor of this building, since we have neighbours (on all sides, this is Amsterdam after all ;) ) we would appreciate it to keep the volume down in the evening and respect them.
