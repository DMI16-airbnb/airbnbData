Located in the heart of Amsterdam this roomy apartment has everything you'd want. Enjoy the perfect location, large living room and exciting neighborhood.\n\nThe apartment is 76 m2 and has one master bedroom and one bedroom for a baby or small child. The hall connects to the large living room and kitchen that also gives you acces to the balcony.\n\nThe apartment is very cozy and quiet. It has just been redone with a fresh coat of paint on the walls, new doors and a brand new kitchen. The living room is located on the south western side which means a lot of sunlight until late in the evening. It's ideal for couples with children and makes the perfect base to explore the city from.\n\nAlthough located only a few meters away from the busy centre you are still able to sleep with the window open and enjoy an awesome night's sleep. The apartment has one bedroom with a queen bed and another one with a baby bed. The master bedroom has a large high quality mattress.\n\nThe combination of a cozy house right in the middle of one of the places that makes Amsterdam so special is ideal. No doubt that you'll feel at home during your stay.\n\nThe actual boss of the house has a passion for cooking so the kitchen is fully equipped up to and including an espresso machine that whips up a cappuccino or latte in an instant. If you feel like staying in and having dinner on your own you will have no problem cooking up something delicious. Of course if you want to go out, there are tons of bars and restaurants around the corner.\n\nIn case you bring children (or you're a gamer yourself): the living room hosts a PS4, giving you parents an easy excuse to sleep in a little (or sleep a little less yourself).\n\nFully equipped kitchen (stove, big fridge, dishwasher, espresso machine), washing machine, 2 televisions.\n\nYou'll be met when you arrive and of course be shown around the house. In,case you have any questions you'll be provided with all the contact details. Well try and respond to any question you might have as soon as possible. We aim to make your stay enjoyable so don't hesitate to ask for anything that would make it more so\n\nThe Nieuwmarkt, which translates into new market, is one of the busiest and cosiest neighbourhoods in Amsterdam. Although located in the city centre it has the allure of a small village. The neighbors know each other and just walking around is one of the best experiences possible.\n\nMoreover, the neighborhood has one of the best bars in Amsterdam, Stevens, which is right around the corner. You can actually see the bar from the large window in the living room. If you want to do something, having a drink, going out for dinner, the Nieuwmarkt is the place to be.\n\nNext to the apartment are numerous restaurants. One that is worth mentioning is Il Sogno, an Italian store that serves the best pizzas in Amsterdam. Oh and did I mention its located next door!\n\nThe appartment is located within walking distance from the central station (around 10 minutes' walk).\n\nYou can also choose to take the subway which is only one stop from the central station. The exit to the subway is literally across the road from the appartment making it conveniently located to explore the rest of Amsterdam.\n\n","description_locale":"en","experiences_offered":"none","extra_user_info":null,"extras_price_native":20,"guests_included":4,"has_agreed_to_legal_terms":null,"has_license":false,"has_viewed_cleaning":null,"has_viewed_ib_perf_dashboard_panel":null,"has_viewed_terms":true,"house_rules":"Please just treat the house like it's your own and you know the neighbors.

There's no need to stay home or something he's used to being alone during the day.

m2 and has one master bedroom and one bedroom for a baby or small child. The hall connects to the large living room and kitchen that also gives you acces to the balcony.\n\nThe apartment is very cozy and quiet. It has just been redone with a fresh coat of paint on the walls, new doors and a brand new kitchen. The living room is located on the south western side which means a lot of sunlight until late in the evening. It's ideal for couples with children and makes the perfect base to explore the city from.\n\nAlthough located only a few meters away from the busy centre you are still able to sleep with the window open and enjoy an awesome night's sleep. The apartment has one bedroom with a queen bed and another one with a baby bed. The master bedroom has a large high quality mattress.\n\nThe combination of a cozy house right in the middle of one of the places that makes Amsterdam so special is ideal. No doubt that you'll feel at home during your stay.\n\nThe actual boss of the house has a passion for cooking so the kitchen is fully equipped up to and including an espresso machine that whips up a cappuccino or latte in an instant. If you feel like staying in and having dinner on your own you will have no problem cooking up something delicious. Of course if you want to go out, there are tons of bars and restaurants around the corner.\n\nIn case you bring children (or you're a gamer yourself): the living room hosts a PS4, giving you parents an easy excuse to sleep in a little (or sleep a little less yourself).","square_feet":null,"star_rating":5.0,"summary":"Lovely, cozy and sunny 1-bedroom apartment with a view of the funky and artsy Nieuwmarkt.

There's no need to stay home or something he's used to being alone during the day. You will of course get paid in love and purring kindness.\n\nIf you wouldn't like to have him around, just say the word and we will let him stay somewhere else, no problem at all.\n\nSmoking is not allowed inside, though we have a small balcony which is sheltered so you nicotine junkies will be fine.","in_building":false,"in_toto_area":false,"recent_review":{"review":{"comments":"Jorit's apartment is lovely and EXACTLY as described. The location is even better then I imagined. It is perfectly situated on a quiet, peaceful street yet still practically ten steps away from everything. Better yet, the layout of apartment is very cozy and inviting. The coffee machine is magical. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for your hospitality Jorit!
