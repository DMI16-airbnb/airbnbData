Right near the centre, the main metrostations and at the same time in a cute and quiet street overlooking the Amstel river. \n\nOur apartment is situated in a hidden nice and quiet neighbourhood right on the corner of the busy Amsterdam centre. The best place to rest before and after exploring Amsterdam is the light and spacious living room from which you can overlook the streets but also the Amstel river. Also we have a beautiful balcony on the south with sun nearly all day. A bathroom with a bath and a sleeping room with a large double bed. \n\nAll house. Including internet, washing machine, dishwashing machine, oven, microwave etc.\n\nBefore arrival we like to know who wants to stay in our house and what you're looking for in Amsterdam. We will give you tips and help you to find your way around. Also, we will be there to give the key and who you around. For questions during your stay you can always contact us on the our mobile phone.\n\nThe neighborhood is small and quiet full of young, working people. All of them are enjoying the Amstel river, going for runs there and chatting around on the streets. Behind our streets is the arty area of Amsterdam, more alternative. And at the other side are the canals and Amsterdam centre. Great place to stay, that's for sure.\n\nAll metro lines pass Weesperplein which is less than 5 minutes from our house. Also in front of the door (norh and south) there are several trams. We have one bike that you can use if you want to feel like a local.\n\nWe are young, working people and in love with our house. Therefore we're looking for people who come to visit Amsterdam to see Amsterdam and who will deal with our house in a responsible way.","description_locale":"en","experiences_offered":"none","extra_user_info":null,"extras_price_native":30,"guests_included":1,"has_agreed_to_legal_terms":null,"has_license":false,"has_viewed_cleaning":null,"has_viewed_ib_perf_dashboard_panel":null,"has_viewed_terms":true,"house_rules":"As long as you keep the neighbors as our friends and treat the house friendly we are happy to lend you our place!","instant_book_welcome_message":null,"interaction":"Before arrival we like to know who wants to stay in our house and what you're looking for in Amsterdam.
