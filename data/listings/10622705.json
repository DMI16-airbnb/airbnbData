Before arriving, Wouter was very accommodating; he found a friend to let us in so that we could drop off our bags early so that we didn't have to carry them around.  He also let us check-out a few hours later which was very convenient and kind.  On the other hand, his communication during our stay was not good.  At one point, he wakes us up at 11:30 p.m. to ask us about when we were planning on leaving the next day, when I had already messaged him many hours previously asking him this and telling him of our plans.  It was not an appropriate time to do this.  Also, he was in and out of our space frequently without knocking or asking, which took away a lot of our privacy.  Although the location is as quiet as Wouter states (which is a blessing in Amsterdam!), it's about a 40 minute walk to the centre and I walk rather quickly.  So do take that under advisement.  Also, we had no access to the kitchen. Although it states that our apartment (which it's not an apartment at all) does not have one, he never states that we would not be allowed to utilise his at all.  I've used Airbnb for a few years now and I've never had a host that allowed us no access to the kitchen.  Finally, on a happy note, the place itself was very clean.  If you are looking for just a bed to sleep on and don't want any privacy, this place is fine; but given the current cost of the place per night, I would have expected a bit more privacy, more appropriate communication through-out our stay, and access to the kitchen.
