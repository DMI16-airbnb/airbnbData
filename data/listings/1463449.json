We toured the apartment, which is spacious, and then spent time showing us the coffee maker operation and laundry room operation adjacent to the bathroom. He also marked a map of local points of interest. The apartment is nicely appointed, spacious and clean! There is a great canal side upscale restaurant \"De Ysbreeker\" that serves breakfast right through dinner. Great location 1/2 block from the canal. We would certainly use his apartment again. Note that the stairs to the apartment are steep and treads narrow.
