close to the center and directly behind most gorgeous section of the Amstel River, this apartment is stylish and very classy.  It's not for party people -- it is for people who want a COMFORTABLE and tranquil stay in the very center of Amsterdam\n\nThis first floor apartment is furnished in style, boasts remarkably high and decorated ceilings, a lift, and is designed for comfortable living.  \n\nThe very bright living room has a classic design with a very modern feel.  There is lots of space and light, which makes it a great spot to unwind after a day of seeing the many sights in Amsterdam. It is a space with a great deal of natural light.  \n\nThe half open and modern kitchen has all the amenities you are looking for to prepare a nice dinner at home.\n\nThe bedroom is spacious and comfortable with a 2 person bed and the bathroom is big with 2 sinks and a bathtub to relax after a day of shopping or sight-seeing.\n\nThe balcony is amazing -- there is furniture to sit and soak in the sun, have a cup of coffee in the morning, or just enjoy the fresh air and the view of the famous Amstel. You will feel very comfortable here!\n\nFor those who do not feel like the stairway, there is a lift to bring you to the apartment.\n\nGuests will have access to the entire apartment including the large balcony, and the elevator!\n\nThis apartment is very close to the central part of the Amstel River (slightly east) and the neighborhood is fantastic!  There are plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, quaint little cafes and arthouse theaters in the neighborhood, as well as some of the great museums of the city, the opera, the botanical gardens and the central waterfront.  It doesn't get all that much more central, while still having a neighborhood feel.\n\nThere is public transport access just in front of the apartment -- it won't take you long to get anywhere!\n\nIf you need to check in to the apartment between 9PM and midnight, this is possible, but there is an additional cost of 25 Euros, after midnight it will be 50 euros.
