This area is a melting pot of great startups, galleries, innovative bars, coffee-, breakfast & lunch venues, restaurants, shops and nightlife. The immediate and more extensive area offers everything to make everyone's stay a success. \n\nWith nice weather one can enjoy a picnic along the river Amstel (2 min walk), at the Artisplein (next to the Zoo) (15 min by public) or in one of the three close by city parks, the “Sarphatipark”, “Oosterpark” or “Frankendael park” (all a 15 min walk). \n\nOne can stroll over one of the 3 nearby open markets:, the “Albert Cuyp” market (15 min walk), the “Dapper” market (15 mins by public, 20 min walk) and the “Waterlooplein” flea market (6 min by public ). Next to that there are several bio week markets in the surroundings.\n\nThere are many ways to discover Amsterdam, using public transport, by foot, bike (rent 5 min by public) or boat.\n\nOne can walk through the picturesque Amsterdam's 17th-century Canal Ring, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2010 (15 min walk to start).\nA canal trip can be made by boat or a boat can be rented (15 min by public, 20 min walk) to discover Amstel river and the city’s canals from a different perspective. \n\nThere are too many museums and galleries to mention close by or easily to reach, for adults, kids and both. \n\nBut, no need to figure it all out on your own, we are looking forward to share all info and inside tips with you upon your arrival to make your stay a great one!","notes":"The rent includes use of: \n- Bed linnen, towels, toilet paper;\n- Free WIFI internet connection; \n- Digital

What a cool place. Beautiful furnishings, wood floors, an incredible kitchen, and cozy balconies...plus it is about 2 minutes walk to the metro and a huge supermarket so super conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood right next to the river. Communication was totally on point and they even left us some stroopwafels to enjoy plus a great pack of information about Amsterdam and the surrounding neighborhood. I would not hesitate to stay here again.
