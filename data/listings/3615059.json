The apartment is very spacious and perfect for my family of five. The location was just right as it was away from the hustle and bustle of city central but near enough for a short commute. \n\nThe only letdown about Paul's place was it was not properly cleaned when we got there, and it is poorly maintained. There was only one garbage can in the entire apartment which was filled with garbage. There were soiled towels still hanging by the towel hooks in the bathroom. The floor wiper was left in the shower area. Worst of all, the toilet seat was not cleaned (it had a small spot on the seat) and there was no toilet paper! There was even a pair of socks left on the ledge behind the toilet. The apartment also smelled like it had been occupied by smokers. The couch was also quite dirty and badly needs to be shampooed. The masters bedroom had very bad lighting with a damaged light fixture in the middle of the room, and no evening lamps on the night tables beside the bed contrary to what you see on the picture.\n\nIf Paul were paying for a cleaning service to clean the apartment, I would strongly recommend replacing that cleaning service. I would have also held off paying the cleaning fee since it was not cleaned well.\n\nAll in all, I would hesitate to stay at Paul's apartment again primarily because it is not well maintained.
