Zimmer zwar recht klein, aber völlig ausreichend für ein paar Wochen. Das Angebot der Gastgeberin, sich unkostenfrei ihr Fahrrad während des Aufenthaltes zu leihen, ist super praktisch, vor allem während der ersten Tage in Amsterdam. Das Zusammenleben mit Patricia und den Katzen insgesamt war sehr entspannt, auch bezüglich Kommen und Gehen früh morgens / spät abends, und gelegentliche Gespräche über einer Tasse Kaffee oder Tee waren immer sehr angenehm. :)","created_at":"2016-06-02T02:22:22Z","id":77548176,"listing_id":583512,"reviewee_id":1545992,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Lisa","has_profile_pic":true,"id":32886647,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/c53de37b-4ba4-4de0-936a-9dcc85d02a70.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/c53de37b-4ba4-4de0-936a-9dcc85d02a70.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":32886647,"role":"guest"}},"toto_opt_in":null,"wireless_info":null,"listing_occupancy_info":{"show_occupancy_message":true},"review_rating_accuracy":8,"review_rating_checkin":10,"review_rating_cleanliness":8,"review_rating_communication":9,"review_rating_location":9,"review_rating_value":9,"is_business_travel_ready":false}}
