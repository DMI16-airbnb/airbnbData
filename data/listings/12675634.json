First of all: it's location could not be any better. The city center is literally across the channel (Amstel). The neighborhood is quite and nice. The apartment is spacious and very well kept. There is a nice terrace overlooking a patio that is not as well kept as it looks in the pictures. We showed up at the arranged time only to find that the cleaning guy was wrapping things up. A few minutes later a nice young lady representing Iambnb, a company that does the management for the owner's flat, showed up to welcome us and give us the house keys. She also gave us a number ((SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) messaging) to contact someone in case of any problems we might encounter. Luckily, there were no big issues. However, I did end up making an attempt to contact the agency... light bulb out in one of the bathrooms ... no hand soap anywhere in the flat ... no batteries in thermostat. Unfortunately, there was no reply except for a message a received a day later: \"we don't provide hand soap\". \n\nI would definitely stay at Karen's place next time I go to Amsterdam. I hope if that is the case the company managing the rental of the place do indeed take care of then guest's meeds. This would really make this place superb!!","created_at":"2016-06-01T04:38:40Z","id":77453132,"listing_id":12675634,"reviewee_id":5299246,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Polo","has_profile_pic":true,"id":1723605,"picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/1723605/profile_pic/1436022381/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/1723605/profile_pic/1436022381/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":1723605,"role":"guest"}},"toto_opt_in":null,"wireless_info":null,"listing_occupancy_info":{"show_occupancy_message":true},"review_rating_accuracy":9,"review_rating_checkin":10,"review_rating_cleanliness":10,"review_rating_communication":9,"review_rating_location":10,"review_rating_value":8,"is_business_travel_ready":false}}
