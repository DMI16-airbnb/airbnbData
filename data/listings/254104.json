Flying Pancake B&B offers two independant spacious suites in a monumental house in the  City Center of Amsterdam between mayor places of interest and public transport.\n\nThe Captain's Suite gives the possibility, through its luxurious furnishing combined with historical elements to experience the ambience of a typical home in Amsterdam. \nThe historical roof construction in the Cook's suite gives this suite its specific character and with only a few adjustments it has resulted in a spacial livingroom with exciting views and a beautiful play with natural light.\n\nBoth suites are equipped for one or two persons: with a double bed, a sitting area with fireplace, a pantry with espresso machine, tea, a microwave and mini-bar. \nBoth suites have their own luxurious bathroom in the suite, with a shower and steam room and toilet. \nOn the technical side: there are a Bang & Olufsen CD- and DVD-player and - TV and high speed internet access. \n\nThe Flying Pancake is established in a monumental house that is listed as a National Historic Building. It was built in 1730. Before starting the Bed and Breakfast Suites a lot of effort and dedication was put in restoring this 5 storey house. The goal was to restore it to its original conditions from the outside and to combine a classic touch with modern comfort on the inside.\n\nWe hope you will enjoy your stay!\n\n****** Please read on for some of the reviews we've received *******\n\nWim Soens (17 March 2011) Iâ€™ve seen a lot of B&Bâ€™s, but I will remember the Flying Pancake for a long time. What a lovely place this is! Very comfortable and charming, and I especially enjoyed the steam shower. Claudia is a great host and made me feel at home right away. Iâ€™ll definitely recommend this place to my friends.\n\nFransiska, Florence (14 March 2011) The best B&B I've ever stayed in. Room was lovely, very clean with a wonderful bathroom with a steam shower. Breakfast was at your door every morning with fresh breads, cheeses and meats. Claudia was a great landlady and provide us bikes and precious hints/suggestions. Would definitely stay here again.\n\nTony, London (07 March 2011) The Flying Pancake offers two separate apartments on the top floors of a typical Dutch house. Each one consists of cooking area, bedroom, living area and bathroom. The level and quality of amenities is very high - the overall feeling is of informal, comfort. I've stayed here several times, and look forward to doing so again later in the year.\n\nDon, California (02 February 2011) Quiet, quaint, great location, good food for breakfast! So much more personal than a hotel. Very clean and all ammenities provided!\n\nMartin & Denise, Malta (08 July 2010) We stayed in The Captain's Suite at the end of June and were very pleased we had chosen The Flying Pancake. The house is in a pleasant and quiet neighbourhood (far enough away from the city centre to be relaxing but close enough to be convenient for all the sights).\n\nThe suite was lovely and exceeded our expectations and Claudia is a friendly and welcoming host.\n\nWe were fortunate to enjoy beautiful weather during our stay so each day we walked into the city (a leisurely 20 minute or so walk) although there was a tram stop close by should we have needed to use it.\n\nWe enjoyed staying here very much and would have no hesitation in recommending it to others. We hope to return one day.\n\nJohn Bullen (25 May 2010) Last week was my second stay at The Flying Pancake while visiting Amsterdam. The Captain's Cabin was spacious, comfortable, charming, and the steam shower will be sorely missed until my next visit. Claudia ensured that all my questions were answered, and she is truly a gracious and accomodating host. The Pancake is located in an historic old Jewish quarter and while not directly in the \"party\" area of the city, it is within just a few steps of the trams which will get you anywhere you wish to go in the city. The #9 tram comes along every 10 minutes or so and will get you to Rembrandt Square - one of the several \"entertainment areas\" - within just a few minutes ride. If you prefer your own transportation, Claudia has bikes to rent at very reasonable rates, and there is an electric scooter sales and rental business just a few doors down the street which rents at 5 Euro a day less than anywhere else I saw.\n\nThe Flying Pancake is definitely on my recommended B&B list for anyone wishing a wonderful experience while in beautiful Amsterdam.\n\nMichael & Deborah Orr (13 March 2010) The Cook's Suite - March 2010. Top marks = 10/10. A truly special guesthouse experience with great attention to detail. A warm and welcoming 'innkeeper.' \nThe location is not absolutely central, but this means you get to see far more of the district between the guesthouse and the city centre and = peace and quiet when you wish for it! Would choose this over a hotel every time. Just be prepared for the typically steep and narrow Dutch staircases!\nThanks Claudia for a wonderful few days...Best wishes, Michael and Debbie\n\nSusan, UK (14 February 2010) I have had a lovely time staying here. It met (and exceeded) my expectations. Thank you for everything!\n\nOur guests have their own sitting room with fireplace, bedroom, pantry and private bathroom with steam shower.\n\nOur guests have their own floor with a private entrance from the street.

B&B offers two independant spacious suites in a monumental house in the  City Center of Amsterdam between mayor places of interest and public transport.\n\nThe Captain's Suite gives the possibility, through its luxurious furnishing combined with historical elements to experience the ambience of a typical home in Amsterdam. \nThe historical roof construction in the Cook's suite gives this suite its specific character and with only a few adjustments it has resulted in a spacial livingroom with exciting views and a beautiful play with natural light.\n\nBoth suites are equipped for one or two persons: with a double bed, a sitting area with fireplace, a pantry with espresso machine, tea, a microwave and mini-bar. \nBoth suites have their own luxurious bathroom in the suite, with a shower and steam room and toilet. \nOn the technical side: there are a Bang & Olufsen CD- and DVD-player and - TV and high speed internet access. \n\nThe Flying Pancake is established in a monumental house that is listed as a National Historic Building. It was built in 1730. Before starting the Bed and Breakfast Suites a lot of effort and dedication was put in restoring this 5 storey house. The goal was to restore it to its original conditions from the outside and to combine a classic touch with modern comfort on the inside.\n\nWe hope you will enjoy your stay!\n\n****** Please read on for some of the reviews we've received *******\n\nWim Soens (17 March 2011) Iâ€™ve seen a lot of B&Bâ€™s, but I will remember the Flying Pancake for a long time. What a lovely place this is! Very comfortable and charming, and I especially enjoyed the steam shower. Claudia is a great host and made me feel at home right away. Iâ€™ll definitely recommend this place to my friends.\n\nFransiska, Florence (14 March 2011) The best B&B I've ever stayed in. Room was lovely, very clean with a wonderful bathroom with a steam shower. Breakfast was at your door every morning with fresh breads, cheeses and meats. Claudia was a great landlady and provide us bikes and precious hints/suggestions. Would definitely stay here again.\n\nTony, London (07 March 2011) The Flying Pancake offers two separate apartments on the top floors of a typical Dutch house. Each one consists of cooking area, bedroom, living area and bathroom. The level and quality of amenities is very high - the overall feeling is of informal, comfort. I've stayed here several times, and look forward to doing so again later in the year.\n\nDon, California (02 February 2011) Quiet, quaint, great location, good food for breakfast! So much more personal than a hotel. Very clean and all ammenities provided!\n\nMartin & Denise, Malta (08 July 2010) We stayed in The Captain's Suite at the end of June and were very pleased we had chosen The Flying Pancake. The house is in a pleasant and quiet neighbourhood (far enough away from the city centre to be relaxing but close enough to be convenient for all the sights).\n\nThe suite was lovely and exceeded our expectations and Claudia is a friendly and welcoming host.\n\nWe were fortunate to enjoy beautiful weather during our stay so each day we walked into the city (a leisurely 20 minute or so walk) although there was a tram stop close by should we have needed to use it.\n\nWe enjoyed staying here very much and would have no hesitation in recommending it to others. We hope to return one day.\n\nJohn Bullen (25 May 2010) Last week was my second stay at The Flying Pancake while visiting Amsterdam. The Captain's Cabin was spacious, comfortable, charming, and the steam shower will be sorely missed until my next visit. Claudia ensured that all my questions were answered, and she is truly a gracious and accomodating host. The Pancake is located in an historic old Jewish quarter and while not directly in the \"party\" area of the city, it is within just a few steps of the trams which will get you anywhere you wish to go in the city. The #9 tram comes along every 10 minutes or so and will get you to Rembrandt Square - one of the several \"entertainment areas\" - within just a few minutes ride. If you prefer your own transportation, Claudia has bikes to rent at very reasonable rates, and there is an electric scooter sales and rental business just a few doors down the street which rents at 5 Euro a day less than anywhere else I saw.\n\nThe Flying Pancake is definitely on my recommended B&B list for anyone wishing a wonderful experience while in beautiful Amsterdam.\n\nMichael & Deborah Orr (13 March 2010) The Cook's Suite - March 2010. Top marks = 10/10. A truly special guesthouse experience with great attention to detail. A warm and welcoming 'innkeeper.' \nThe location is not absolutely central, but this means you get to see far more of the district between the guesthouse and the city centre and = peace and quiet when you wish for it! Would choose this over a hotel every time. Just be prepared for the typically steep and narrow Dutch staircases!\nThanks Claudia for a wonderful few days...Best wishes, Michael and Debbie\n\nSusan, UK (14 February 2010) I have had a lovely time staying here. It met (and exceeded) my expectations.
