very centrally located lovely 1904 canal house apartment puts you right in the middle of Amsterdam! 30 minutes from the airport, a great relaxing balcony and 2 mins from the Amstel river and Carré!\n\nNote: We are only looking for people willing to take care of our cat (Lucy) during their stay, if this is not a problem, then feel free to contact us! \n\n----\n\nThis very centrally located lovely 1904 canal house apartment puts you right in the middle of Amsterdam! With a front-side canal view and a rear side sunny balcony so you relax at home between outings to the center.\n\nThe apartment is situated on the 3rd floor of a lovely 1904 canal house. The view over the canal can be enjoyed from the large living room, as well as from a north-oriented balcony, perfect for a hot-summer’s-day-glass-of-wine. If you rather enjoy full sun, you can sit on our south-oriented balcony, which is directly connected to our fully equipped kitchen and dining room. Our bedroom, furnished with a comfortable double bed, lies on the cool north side of the apartment and overlooks the canal. The second bedroom/office can be used as a working place as well as a spare bedroom. An extra two person mattress is available. \n\nOur apartment’s location offers the best of Amsterdam – it is just a 3 minute walk from the Hermitage Museum, the famous Magere Brug (Skinny Bridge) and the Royal Theater Carré, but also only 10 minutes from other tourist attractions such as the Rijksmuseum, the Dam and the Nieuwmarkt. If you wish to get a feel for how Dutch people like to spend their free time, the area of Weesperbuurt-Plantage (3 min. walk) is just the place for you. It offers great ‘kroegen’ (Dutch pubs), the student-run cinema ‘Kriterion’ and the romantic 19th century park ‘Oosterpark’. And if all of this isn’t enough, our apartment is only 100 meters from the tram & metro, so you can reach Schiphol Airport (25 mins) and Amsterdam Central Station (5 mins) quickly and comfortably.\n\nIn short, our apartment offers the following facilities:\n-A spacious living room (with flat screen TV and piano)\n-A fully equipped kitchen (oven, microwave, gas cooker, fridge, dishwasher, toaster, blender) \n-A dining room\n-A bedroom, with plenty of closet space\n-An office / second bedroom\n-A bathroom (shower and washbasin. Separate toilet)\n-Two sun-drenched balconies, one overlooking the canal\n-Towels, linen, hairdryer\n-Free WiFi + Airport Express & Apple TV for your own music/videos\n\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us!\n\nPlease note: no profile, no booking! Just as you want to know a bit about us, we would like to know a bit about you. Please complete your profile with some background info and the reason for your visit. Thanks!\n\nA fully equipped house\n\nWe'll be on holiday ourselves, but we're only a phone call away, and in case anything is up, I can have a friend come over to help you guys out.\n\nWe're right in the middle of the centre, but away from the immediate hustle and bustle. Walk to the Amstel river (Carré) in 2 minutes but at the same time enjoy a relaxing read on our balcony!\n\nWe're right next to Weesperplein (tram and subway), which puts you at the airport in 30 mins and across town with the tram in 15.\n\nWe want to request our guests to provide some food and water to our cat while you are staying at the apartment, she does not like to be moved out of the house :)","description_locale":"en","experiences_offered":"none","extra_user_info":null,"extras_price_native":50,"guests_included":2,"has_agreed_to_legal_terms":null,"has_license":false,"has_viewed_cleaning":null,"has_viewed_ib_perf_dashboard_panel":null,"has_viewed_terms":true,"house_rules":"We have a good relationship with all neighbours, which we would like to keep that way.

apartment puts you right in the middle of Amsterdam! With a front-side canal view and a rear side sunny balcony so you relax at home between outings to the center.\n\nThe apartment is situated on the 3rd floor of a lovely 1904 canal house. The view over the canal can be enjoyed from the large living room, as well as from a north-oriented balcony, perfect for a hot-summer’s-day-glass-of-wine. If you rather enjoy full sun, you can sit on our south-oriented balcony, which is directly connected to our fully equipped kitchen and dining room. Our bedroom, furnished with a comfortable double bed, lies on the cool north side of the apartment and overlooks the canal. The second bedroom/office can be used as a working place as well as a spare bedroom. An extra two person mattress is available. \n\nOur apartment’s location offers the best of Amsterdam – it is just a 3 minute walk from the Hermitage Museum, the famous Magere Brug (Skinny Bridge) and the Royal Theater Carré, but also only 10 minutes from other tourist attractions such as the Rijksmuseum, the Dam and the Nieuwmarkt. If you wish to get a feel for how Dutch people like to spend their free time, the area of Weesperbuurt-Plantage (3 min. walk) is just the place for you. It offers great ‘kroegen’ (Dutch pubs), the student-run cinema ‘Kriterion’ and the romantic 19th century park ‘Oosterpark’. And if all of this isn’t enough, our apartment is only 100 meters from the tram & metro, so you can reach Schiphol Airport (25 mins) and Amsterdam Central Station (5 mins) quickly and comfortably.\n\nIn short, our apartment offers the following facilities:\n-A spacious living room (with flat screen TV and piano)\n-A fully equipped kitchen (oven, microwave, gas cooker, fridge, dishwasher, toaster, blender) \n-A dining room\n-A bedroom, with plenty of closet space\n-An office / second bedroom\n-A bathroom (shower and washbasin. Separate toilet)\n-Two sun-drenched balconies, one overlooking the canal\n-Towels, linen, hairdryer\n-Free WiFi + Airport Express & Apple TV for your own music/videos\n\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us!\n\nPlease note: no profile, no booking! Just as you want to know a bit about us, we would like to know a bit about you. Please complete your profile with some background info and the reason for your visit.
