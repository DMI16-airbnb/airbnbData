houseboat has kitchen with coffee & tea, living, bathroom, 2 bedrooms with 3 comfy boxspring beds, central heating & WIFI! Very central near metro, train, tram, supermarket, riverside restaurants & bars. Walk to the center along the river\n\nA charming little houseboat all to yourself in a great central location! Comes with fully equipped kitchen with coffee & tea, compact bathroom with shower and regular toilet. There's one bedroom with comfortable double box spring bed and a small second bedroom with a single box spring bed.\n\nOutside there is an entrance terrace and a wide grassy lane for picknick and play right in front of the houseboat. In the winter you might like the comfortable central heating. There's WIFI too!\n\nThe whole place is yours!\n\nWe welcome you personally upon arrival and will get you settled in and answer all questions you may have. Where to go and what to see etc. And you can always contact us of course so we make your stay and visit to Amsterdam into a success! Guaranteed!\n\nThe houseboat is in a quiet spot for quiet nights yet you are walking distance from the center. There are many bars and good restaurants nearby. Further along the street you find riverside cafes and restaurants. We recommend a few places like restaurant Dauphine, an old Renault car garage converted into restaurant, restaurant \"Rijssel\" for classic french cuisine with a hip twist, \"The Ysbreeker\" for coffee and drinks and 7th floor rooftop restaurant \"Canvas\" at the \"Volkshotel\" with a great view over the city. All within a 5 to 10 minute walk. Contact us for reservations, no problem. We also compiled a folder with recommendations on where to go\n\nMetro, train, tram and bus are all within walking distance. The subway (Metro) is very close and brings you to and from Central Station in a few minutes.\n\nThe Amstel is the famous river of Amsterdam with many houseboats lined up on it's bank. Sometimes one, sometimes two, three or four alongside eachother. There are two houseboats next to eachother where we are. We have the first in line meaning there's no real view from inside over the river. The view is from the left (bedroom) and right (livingroom) looking past the houseboat in front. It's still a great view from the bedroom and livingroom though and there a pleasant green view and 10m2 of terrace at the entrance","description_locale":"en","experiences_offered":"none","extra_user_info":null,"extras_price_native":25,"guests_included":2,"has_agreed_to_legal_terms":true,"has_license":false,"has_viewed_cleaning":null,"has_viewed_ib_perf_dashboard_panel":null,"has_viewed_terms":true,"house_rules":"No smoking and no drugs please and we trust you respect the place like we would yours","instant_book_welcome_message":null,"interaction":"We welcome you personally upon arrival and will get you settled in and answer all questions you may have.

It really gave some extra to the Amsterdam feeling! As you open your eyes in the morning, you can see the Amstel from your bed. You can have your coffe watching the ducks, or the joggers and bikers by the river. The location is good, you can easily reach everything. The houseboat is clean, and comfortable for three persons. Olle is a really good and helpful host. We can't wait to go again!\n","created_at":"2016-04-24T02:03:20Z","id":71090088,"listing_id":8483676,"reviewee_id":35994211,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"Ildiko","has_profile_pic":true,"id":52283575,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/a70ea240-01f1-4e45-8e48-fb6c7c89ffcd.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/a70ea240-01f1-4e45-8e48-fb6c7c89ffcd.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":52283575,"role":"guest"}},"toto_opt_in":null,"wireless_info":null,"listing_occupancy_info":{"show_occupancy_message":true},"review_rating_accuracy":10,"review_rating_checkin":10,"review_rating_cleanliness":9,"review_rating_communication":10,"review_rating_location":9,"review_rating_value":10,"is_business_travel_ready":false}}
