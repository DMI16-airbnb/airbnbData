beautiful appartment in a canal house from 1671, overlooking the river Amstel. Very centrally located and prettily decorated. Quaint, homey and with a spectacular view of the iconic 'skinny bridge' and theatre Carré. Amsterdam at its best!\n\nThe house is light, bright and lovely. It's been recently refurbished so everything looks shiny and fresh. Both the bathroom and kitchen are modern and comfortable. And my girlfriend has done most of the decorating, so it's got class ;). \n\nMy personal touch can be found in a small (female friendly!) man cave with nice old cinema seats, a projector and surround sound system. Great for creating your own home cinema, or for playing on the Wii U or Playstation! The room can also be used as a quiet office space, with a pleasant chair and desk.\n\nThe river Amstel gave the city it's name! From here all the other canals in the city radiate outwards, like spokes in a wheel. We're right across from the famous Carré theatre, the fancy Prinsengracht is around the corner, as are the boutique shopping street Utrechtsestraat and the Waterloo square with its fun daily fleamarket. And of course there the Magere Brug (the iconic 'Skinny Bridge') right on our doorstep.\n\nMetro station Waterloo Square is a 5-minute walk away and the convenient tram 4 stops around the corner.\n\nOur wonderful view comes at a small price: do note that our appartment is at the top of a very steep flight of stairs. If you have impaired mobility, I'm afraid it might not be for you. \n\nFinally, our bed is quite old-school and rather small for a 2-person bed (1.20 x 1.90). Very snug and romantic of course, but if you need space to sprawl, feel free to inflate our luxurious kingsize matress!","description_locale":"en","experiences_offered":"none","extra_user_info":null,"extras_price_native":30,"guests_included":2,"has_agreed_to_legal_terms":true,"has_license":false,"has_viewed_cleaning":null,"has_viewed_ib_perf_dashboard_panel":null,"has_viewed_terms":true,"house_rules":"Amsterdam is a city of liberty, so no need for a long list of rules.
