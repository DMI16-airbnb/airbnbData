The perfect place for breakfast or a romantic dinner.\n\nThe Neighborhood\nThe apartment is situated on the border of \"De Pijp” and “East” next to the Amstel river. De Pijp and East are famous for its bars, cafes, vibrant atmosphere and friendly surroundings. \nThis apartment is situated in the heart of Amsterdam next to the Amstel river, ideal for a run, a stroll or just to grab a drink in one of the many bars and restaurants. It’s very close to the Albert Cuyp market and 4 minutes from the Utrechtsestraat (our favourite street in Amsterdam). The apartment is an ideal place to stay for (young) couples.\n\nOn walking distance of: \n• The OosterPark (3 min)\n• De Pijp (3 min)\n• The Sarphatipark (5 min) \n• Bars/restaurants area at the Amstel (1 min) \n• Bars/restaurants area in East (3 min) \n• Famous canals of Amsterdam (4 min)\n\nGetting Around\nSubway / Metro is around the corner and 6 minutes later (4 stops) you'll arrive at Central Station, 5 stops (8 min) towards the opposite direction will take you to the RAI (conference center).\n\nOn biking distance of:\n• Van Gogh Museum (8 min) \n• Anne Frank House (15 min) \n• The Rijksmuseum (8 min) \n• Stedelijk museum (8 min) \n• The RAI (10 min) \n• The Hermitage (4 min) \n• The Leidseplein (6 min) \n• The Rembrandts Plein (6 min) \n• Reguliers Dwarsstraat (6 min) \n• The shopping streets: Kalverstraat, Leidsestraat or the “Nine Streets” (10 min) \n• \"De Jordaan\" (15 min)\n\nDriving distance of: \n• Beach (30 minutes) \n• The Hague (45 min), Rotterdam (60 min), Antwerp (90 minutes), Brussels (2 hours), Paris (5 hours), Berlin (6 hours).\n\nWe are very pleased with our home and we take care of our belongings.

A lot of new nice bars, coffee places and restaurants have opened here in the past few years. With a bike on your side all parts of Amsterdam can be reached in max 15 minutes (the good parts between 0 and 8 minutes).\n\nThe subway is around the corner which takes you straight to Central station or the RAI (or Arena for soccer fans). Furthermore Amsterdam is about biking. You can rent a bike for around 7 eur per day which is recommended. The bike store is very close to the apartment.\n\nThe apartment is on the first floor of the building and has it's own 'rooftop' terrace (also on the first floor), which is quite unique for an apartment that is not on the top floor.","description_locale":"en","experiences_offered":"none","extra_user_info":null,"extras_price_native":30,"guests_included":1,"has_agreed_to_legal_terms":true,"has_license":false,"has_viewed_cleaning":null,"has_viewed_ib_perf_dashboard_panel":null,"has_viewed_terms":true,"house_rules":"Behave, be nice, be clean and enjoy","instant_book_welcome_message":"Hi, my name is Patrick and you'll be staying in the apartment where I live together with my girlfriend Charlotte and our baby Bo.
