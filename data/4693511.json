Should you need a break from sightseeing, a 42 inch plasma with lots of movies is in the bedroom.\n\nWe will move out for the time you rent our apartment, so you will have the place to yourself.\n\n\nAccess to everything as we will not be there.\n\nYou will have the place to yourself, of course you can always message or call us with any questions.\n\nThe 19th century Weesperzijde neighbourhood borders the Amstel river. Although generally quiet, the area has lots of restaurants and also some nice bars, with one of the most popular (Hesp) located at the corner of our street.\n\nAt walking distance, across the river, you will find the trendy neighbourhood “the Pijp” which together with the “Jordaan” (located north-west in Amsterdam) are the two most popular nightlife areas for Amsterdammers.\n\nA supermarket and a park are at walking distance.\n\nA stroll to the centre along the riverside of the Amstel is highly recommended, along the beautiful and quiet route you will pass landmarks such as the Amstel hotel and Royal Theatre Carre.\n\n\nMetro (2 minutes walk), Train (5 minutes) or Tram (3 minutes) \n\nWe will provide you with 2 bikes so you can reach all the hotspots the local way.
