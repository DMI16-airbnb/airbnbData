The apartment is well located close to one of Amsterdam's many canals, and to a supermarket, restaurants, bike rentals, and the subway system. it is up two flights of Amsterdam's infamous steep narrow stairways, but you get used to it. The apartment itself had the best stocked kitchen I've seen in a rental property, not only in hardware but in cooking items like spices, etc. We were greeted by his agent who gave us a tour. It had good high speed Wifi. We settled in nicely and enjoyed our visit to Amsterdam, and visited many of the highly recommended sites. Although we didn't actually meet Alfred, he seemed by email to be very affable person. We were very satisfied.","created_at":"2015-10-07T11:26:12Z","id":49877396,"listing_id":4439824,"reviewee_id":23043145,"reviewer":{"user":{"first_name":"David","has_profile_pic":true,"id":31071519,"picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/31071519/profile_pic/1428859817/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","thumbnail_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/31071519/profile_pic/1428859817/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small"}},"reviewer_id":31071519,"role":"guest"}},"toto_opt_in":null,"wireless_info":null,"listing_occupancy_info":{"show_occupancy_message":false},"review_rating_accuracy":9,"review_rating_checkin":9,"review_rating_cleanliness":9,"review_rating_communication":10,"review_rating_location":10,"review_rating_value":9,"is_business_travel_ready":false}}
